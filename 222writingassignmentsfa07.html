Also, what are the key words and images in the stanza? How does the stanza connect with the ideas of the Enlightenment we've discussed? What is the attitude of the narrator? What is the role of nature, especially animals, if any appear in your stanza?</p>
<p class="style1">2)<span class="style7"> <span class="style44">After reading Shannon Chapter 1, write your own definition of literature to turn in. Make it as short and complete as possible.</span></span></p>

  On your My Courses page, click on FL 222. <br />
  Click on Student Orientation to WebCT. Read Sections 1 and 5. <br />

  Click on Introduction.<br />
  You will see the first topic, Introductory Post, by me. Read the assignment (Please introduce yourself to the rest of the class and tell us: if you could invite any three people, alive, dead or fictional, to dinner at your place, whom would you invite, why, and what would you serve?). Respond. </p>
<p class="style1"> 4) See the <a href="Type/ExtraCreditType.html">Extra Credit Assignment on <em>Myers-Briggs Type in College</em></a> I'm INFJ. If you have comments or questions about Myers-Briggs Type, feel free to share them as part of the introduction. You can do this assignment any time in the first month of classes. </p>
<p class="style1"><span class="style7">Class 4 (Voltaire, Lecture 1) <span class="style13">due Wednesday, </span> <span class="style13">August 29 </span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style44">1) Write a page about the first thirteen chapters of <em>Candide</em> answering Shannon's 4 questions. </span></span></p>
<p class="style1">2) Read Shannon, Chapter 2. </p>
<p class="style1">3) Print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222ShortStoryNovel.html">Different Forms of Prose Fiction</a>; <a href="222SatireIronyUtopia.html">Satire, Irony and Utopia</a>, <a href="222Panglossian.htm">Panglossian</a>.</p>
<p class="style1">4) Consider bookmarking an online dictionary or two to make it easy to look up words you don't know. If you are doing the Reading Notebook, you can print out the definitions to include in your notebook. <br />
    <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/">http://dictionary.reference.com/</a><br />
  <a href="http://www.m-w.com/">http://www.m-w.com/</a></p>
<p class="style1"><span class="style45">Class 5 (Voltaire, Lecture 2) <span class="style13">due Friday, August 31 </span><br />
      <span class="style4">Discuss the following question after you do the reading. Is Eldorado a genuine utopia or (in one critic's words) &quot;a colossal bore&hellip;satirized by Voltaire as foolish and futile&quot;? Which specific behaviors or institutions show us that Voltaire wants the reader to see Eldorado as utopic?  Does Voltaire have a philosophical lesson in mind or is it pure satire? Or both?</span></span> How does it correspond to your personal view of Utopia? <span class="style4">Quote from the text with examples to support your answers.</span></p>
<p class="style1">See Lecture Notes on <a href="222dulce.html">Dulce et utile</a> ; read Shannon, Chapter 3. </p>
<p class="style1">The first original contribution post&mdash;on Pope&mdash;is due Friday at midnight. You will have many authors to choose from to do your required 13 posts (7 original contributions and 6 responses), but I encourage you to get in the habit of posting by starting with Pope or Voltaire. For an original contribution post, make a point or develop an argument of at least 7 lines based on something you read, learned or thought while reading <em>An Essay on Man</em>. It can be helpful to ask a question or make a provocative statement for your classmates to respond to. Did something in your homework get praise or a lot of comment from me? If so, it might be the basis of a good post. </p>
<p class="style1"><span class="style7">Class 6 (Voltaire, Lecture 3)</span> <span class="style13">due Wednesday, Sept. 5 </span><br />
Read the page in Supplementary Materials, <a href="Candide%20quotes.html">Quotes from different critics about &quot;Il faut cultiver notre jardin.&quot; </a><br />
Write a page answering the following questions: what are some  literal and figurative meanings of the word <em>garden</em>? How do they apply here? How do <strong>you</strong> interpret the final line of the story?</p>
<p class="style1">What do I mean by <strong>literal</strong> and <strong>figurative</strong>? Here is an example I found online at <a href="http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm">http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm</a> : <br />
    <br />
    <strong>literal</strong> vs. <strong>figurative</strong> meaning - relates to the meanings of words and phrases or expressions. For example, &quot;She was all ears&quot; has a <strong>figurative</strong> meaning (She was listening intently) as well as a <strong>literal</strong> meaning (Her body was composed of ears or she had a huge set of ears). </p>

READER RESPONSE CRITICISM</span></p>
<p class="style1">Here are two additional sets of critical questions you may choose to address. They were written by a former student, Garry Pigg (Fall, 2005)</p>
<p class="style33">ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM </p>
<p class="style1">1. How do the environmental/ecological conditions within the setting of the work affect the language, mood, tone, and theme?<br />
  2. How does the use of the word &quot;nature&quot; in the work reflect the current scientific beliefs of the time and how does that affect the characters, plot, themes?<br />
  3. How does the relationship between man/woman and his/her environment--economically, agriculturally, botanically, socially--affect the characters, language, theme, plot, and tone? i.e. do the characters have to hunt and gather, farm, trade, live in city, country?<br />
  4. How do plants, animals, and their conditions in the environment affect the character's livelihood, the plot, the author's tone, the moods, the theme? i.e. the effects of individual species such as cows, camels, horses,goats, bananas, sugar, cotton, corn, potatoes, fungi, bacteria,<br />
  viruses; and ambient conditions such as drought, flooding, pollution, climate change, introduction of invasive species, and famine.</p>
<p class="style33">QUEER THEORY </p>
<p class="style1">1. How do the cultural feelings about sex affect the characters, plot, and themes?<br />
  2. How does sexual identity affect the characters? How do they deal with others and their own sexual deviance or breaking of social norms?<br />
  3. How does homosexuality or bisexuality play a role in the characters' lives, the tone, mood, theme, and plot of the work?<br />
  4. What role does sexuality play in the work?  How does it affect the use of language? Does it represent love and beauty or marriage and<br />
  reproduction?<br />
  5. How does religion affect the tendencies of the characters to express or not express themselves sexually?<br />
  6. How does the work represent sex and sexuality?  Does it use sexuality to define &quot;others&quot;? Does discussion of sex in the work hinder or help feminism?  Does it hurt or help racism, discrimination in general, and civil rights?  What is the connection between sexuality, race, gender, and social class in the work(s)?</p>

    <br />
    <span class="style4">Both sections are listed together here.<br />
</span></span><br />
  <span class="style31"><span class="style32">&bull; FORMALIST CRITICISM: <br />
<span class="style4">&bull; How do the elements of the story, in particular, the references to cattle, windows, doors and clothing, reinforce the realist beliefs held by Flaubert?<br />
&bull; How does the way Emma falls for different charactesrs (Leon, Rodolphe) other than her husband reinforce what we already know about her personality form the previous chapters? </span><br />
  <br />
  &bull; </span></span><span class="style32">SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM <br />
Marxist Criticism: <span class="style4">Steven, Kaitlin <br />
&bull; Although Emma knows Charles can't afford her lavish spending, she continues to waste money. How does this relate to her prior class distinction?<br />
&bull;  According to Karl Marx, &quot;money is the root of all evil.&quot; How do you think this applies to Madame Bovary in reference to the outcome of Charles and Emma?<br />
&bull; Is the portrayal of Emma as a spoiled brat a way in which the class structure is criticized? <br />
  |</span><br />
  Feminist Criticism: <span class="style4"><br />
  &bull; 
  Emma's relationship with L&eacute;on is a source of conflict, but also a source of resolution. How so? <br />
  &bull;   
  Gender roles are important in <em>Madame Bovary</em>. Do you feel that Emma is miserable all the time because she is female or it because society has forced women to think and feel in Emma's way? <br />
  &bull;  
  How is Emma's role as a woman portrayed in the novel? Does it change throughout and if so, do you think any of the other characters influence this feminine role?  <br />
  &bull; 
  What are the differences/similarities of how women are represented in <em>Candide</em> and <em>Madame Bovary</em>?<br />
  &bull;  
  Why does Emma Bovary want to wear man-like clothes? What does this mean? <br />
  &bull; 
  There are many reasons why Emma rejects her gender role in terms of work, character, expectations. What is the <strong>main </strong>factor why Emma rejects the role of women in the story and why? <br />
  &bull;  
  How are women's lives portrayed in the work? Do the women accept or reject these roles? ;<br />
  &bull;  
  Compare and contrast Emma's real life to the fantasy life that she dreams of. How is her life affected by the roles of women as portrayed by the romantic style of literature? <br />
  &bull; 
  How does Emma Bovary play her role as a wife, a mother, and a friend to the other characters in the story. How do the other characters respond to her actions and how could this affect her social life? <br />
  &bull; 
  What motivations characterize the relationships between men and women in <em>Madame Bovary</em>? eg dominance, power, submission, pleasure, monetary gain, charity, escape, survival, etc. <br />
&bull;  Why does it seem that women are the basis of all the problems in this novel??? (ie complaining, breaking up of marriages, etc.) <br />
  </span><br />
&bull; 
    CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICSM: <br />
    <span class="style4">&bull; Between the 18th and 19th centuries, there was a huge cultural change in France. The Revolution and age of revolt and rebellion were over. With culture changing, literature followed. Gustave Flaubert himself changes from a romantic to a realist. One of his best examples of realism is <em>Madame Bovary</em>. What examples in Madame Bovary show the realism and do you think Flaubert brings a romantic double agent to the story? If so, who and why?<br />
    &bull;
    What are Flaubert's views on the church clergy as defined by Abb&eacute; Bournisien's character throughout <em>Madame Bovary</em>? <br />
    &bull; 
    In the case of the pharmacist Homais, he had no license to practice medicine. So do you believe this is a very common thing among people of this time period not to check a person's credentials out before receiving treatment?  <br />
    &bull;
    Why does Flaubert repeatedly use animals to describe human behavior? Is it historical or cultural to compare nature to human behavior?  <br />
    &bull; Does Emma's behavior differ from that of a 21st century woman? What specific aspects of Flaubert's <em>Madame Bovary</em> were representative of the time in which it was written (1856)? For example, you could look at the importance of class, the relationship between husband and wife, and the roles of other minor characters (such as the priest) as pertaining to that time frame in relation to how they were described in the text?   <br />
    &bull;
    Why did Flaubert attack the new middle class (bourgeois) in <em>Madame Bovary </em>and make fun of their incompetence and their lack of taste? <br />
    &bull;  
    What was the common attitude toward adultery during this time period? I can remember reading <em>The Scarlet Letter</em> in which it was a horrible crime. Did this story strike a lot of controversy in that respect? <br />
    &bull; 
Does Gustave Flaubert accurately depict 19th century France in <em>Madame Bovary</em> or are there faults within the novel? <br />
  &bull; The middle 19th century in France was a time of industrial revolution and the rise of the bourgeoisie. What characters and aspects of <em>Madame Bovary</em> reflect middle 19th century in France with respect to industrialization and the rise of the bourgeoisie?<br />
  &bull; Although <em>Madame Bovary</em> is thought of as a realist novel, is this really a realist novel intended for the vast majority or is it more of a satire or even an antithesis to romanticism intended for people critical of romantic works? <br />
  Justin  <br />
    </span><br />
&bull; 
    PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM: <span class="style4"><br />
    &bull;
    How do Emma's dreams and desires for a more fulfilling and exciting life reflect the dreams and desires of Flaubert? Do Emma's internal wishes reflect the wishes of Flaubert?   <br />
    &bull;
    What does Emma's character, her behavior, and emotions reveal about her psychological state? Describe her personality in detail as well as how her attitude reflects her psychological state. What does Emma's character reflect about Flaubert? <br />
    &bull; 
    What psychological factors influenced emma when she first met Rodolphe?, If personality is defined as the organized pattern of behavioral characteristics of the individual, how would you describe Emma's?<br />
    &bull; 
    Why does Emma get so much joy out of being sad? Why can't she ever truly be happy? What does she <strong>really</strong> want from life? What are her <strong>real</strong> dreams?  <br />
    &bull;
    How does Emma's affair with Leon affect her mood and feelings towards her marriage with Charles? <br />
    &bull; 
    Throughout <em>Madame Bovary</em> Emma was consumed by a fantasy world of romanticism. Nothing was ever good enough for her. Does this show Emma's weak psychological state? If so, was there anything the other characters could have done to help her? <br />
    &bull; 
    What do Emma's actions, emotions, and behavior towards her child and Charles tell the reader about her psychological state? Could it foreshadow later events in the story?<br /> 
    &bull; Emma Bovary is subject to the decisions of many people around her. First her father persuades her to marry a man she doesn't love, and still later she is subjected to rules of society. Do you think that Emma's mistakes or bad decisions are a product of the effect that these factors have on her, or is she just acting selfishly? </span><br />
  <br />
&bull;
  READER RESPONSE CRITICISM</span>: <br />
  Flaubert makes it clear that he is a realist author. Do you feel that he portrays his realism throughout <em>Madame Bovary</em>? Does it change into other forms of writing such as romanticism?<br />
  &bull; 
  Do you think Charles know what is going on between his wife, Emma, and other men? What point do you think Flaubert was trying to get across to his readers? <br />
  &bull; 
  How do you respond to the ups, down, and numerous blindsiding aspects of the novel and what are the influencing factors in this outlook? <br />
  &bull; <span class="style4">Flaubert provides a sense of insecurity through Emma's character. Is this insecurity a reflection of Flaubert's feelings or experiences in life? What is Flaubert thinking when he continues to make Emma's life a miserable happiness? <br />
  &bull; 
  Flaubert repeatedly uses references to animals to refer to the fallacies that he sees in his characters, whether it be in the name of the novel itself or whether he is describing characters to have characteristics like horses, pigs, and other &quot;lower&quot; animals. Was this from a personal bias or just from the style of writing in the ear? What is Flaubert's view on evolution and the intelligence of non-humans? </span><br />
  <span class="style4">Jihad</span></p>
<p class="style1"><span class="style47">&bull; ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM: <br />
  <span class="style4">&bull; If Emma is truly in pursuit of a happy life as defined by wealth, why does she choose to move to Yonville, a town known more for its dead than its living? <br />
    &bull;
  How do we see Emma's language, mood, tone and them change, as she makes her way from her father's farm to living with Charles in Tostes and then on to Yonville-l'Abbaye? </span> </span></p>
<p class="style1"><span class="style47">&bull; QUEER THEORY: <span class="style4"><br />
  &bull;
  Emma tries to run off more than one time to be with someone other than Charles, each time willing to take or leave Berthe. Does Emma's need for sexual approval eventually hurt Berthe the most?   <br />
  &bull;
  How far does sex and sexuality affect Emma's life? In what ways does she use her sexuality to her advantage and in what ways is she a victim to her sexuality?  <br />
  &bull;
  Why do you think that idea of sex (writing or discussion) has changed so dramatically since the time period that <em>Madame Bovary</em> was written? </span></span> Why is our generation so much more open or comfortable with sex? Could the answer be attributed to exposure from writers like Flaubert?<br />

<p class="style39">Steps for writing Paper 1<br />
  - Step 1: read, re-read and annotate your texts; write a one page outline for your paper, following your preferred outline style (see Shannon, Chapter 4); include a fully formulated thesis.</p>
<p class="style1"><em>- Step 2: read Shannon chapter 5, pp. 100 &ndash; 132; write a first draft of 1-2 pages about one of the topics below for the peer review session. It should have a working title and a fully formulated introduction (you can rewrite them later, but they need to be there for the draft) and several finished paragraphs; your audience knows the text, so you should avoid plot summaries. Use the present tense for literary analysis: Ivan is an ambitious&hellip; Flaubert reveals&hellip; Include your outline. This is the peer review draft version of paper 1; print and bring 2 copies of it to class. Include the <a href="PeerReviewFeedback.html">Peer Review Feedback form</a> from the <a href="222supmatf04.html">Supplementary Materials</a> page with each copy</em>.</p>

Finish reading <font color="#000000"><em>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</em></font>. The first half of class will be devoted to discussing it. </p>
<p class="style1"><font color="#000000">The second half of class will be devoted to peer review of the first draft of <a href="222Paper1.html">Paper 1</a>. Be sure to print out <strong>two copies</strong> of the <a href="PeerReviewFeedback.html">Peer Review Feedback Form</a> to include with the <strong>two copies</strong> of your draft which you will bring for your classmates. <a href="mailto:DiBeckman@earthlink.net">Email</a> me before class if you have an idea for your own original topic so that I can approve it. </font></p>
<p class="style1">I've just added this to the web page about Paper 1--Dr. Beckman's hint about titles: A dull title sets expectations low. A good title invites the reader! Quotes, proverbs or aphorisms make great titles. Try a google search with a key word from your thesis (pride, satisfaction, quest, etc) and the word quote. I've already got a <a href="222Lovequotes.html">web page</a> with love quotes for you to use, since love is such a popular topic. </p>

Father, an intellectual, marries a lower class woman; they have a son, but the Father becomes bored with his wife and sends her off to live with his male secretary. Father keeps custody of the Son, who is raised by a wet nurse and grows up to be very resentful. The wife obediently leaves the family home and she and the former secretary have 3 more children. The Father watches over them, but eventually they move away; the stepfather dies, and the wife and three children move back to the original town without telling the Father. Mother and Stepdaughter take jobs with a dressmaker, Madame Pace, who runs a call-girl service: Mother as a seamstress, Stepdaughter as a prostitute, who is ultimately hired by the Father. Family is reunited: explosive conflict.</p>
<p class="style1">There is no daily writing assignment due on Friday. However, you could keep the writing assignment for next Wednesday in mind as you read.  (Power struggles revisited. Three characters struggle for power in Pirandello's play: the producer, the father and the stepdaughter.

Advice about how to read: keep in mind that the first pages are a series of associations made by a person drifting off to sleep; don&rsquo;t be freaked out by how long the sentences are; read quickly (don&rsquo;t stop to wonder what each images means or what is allusion is). Get to the end of the &ldquo;digression&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll see how it connects thematically with another &ldquo;digression&rdquo; as a chains of association. </span><br />

  <span class="style43">For two possible explanations for Marcel's behavior, </span><br />
  <span class="style43">1) Read about separation/anxiety disorder:<br />

  <br />
2) Also: &quot;The Oedipus complex in Freudian psychoanalysis refers to stage of psychosexual development in childhood where children of both sexes regard their father as an adversary and competitor for the exclusive love of their mother. The name of the complex derives from the Greek myth of Oedipus, who unwittingly kills his father Laius and marries his mother Jocasta.<br />
<br />
Freud considered the successful resolution of the Oedipus complex to be key to the development of gender roles and identity, with boys and girls resolving the conflicts differently as a result of castration anxiety and penis envy. Freud also held that the unsuccessful resolution of the Oedipus complex could result in neurosis and homosexuality.&hellip; Although common usage refers to 'suffering from an Oedipus complex', psychoanalysis does not consider the complex a pathology, but instead a perfectly normal stage that all children go through. Oedipal desires are thought to remain heavily repressed and unconsciously in the minds of all functioning adults.</span>&quot; <br />

Question 1: Who is Judith Shakespeare? Why does Woolf create her? What  the message about women and women writers that Woolf suggests by telling the Judith's story? </p>
<p class="style14">Question 2: Choose any work we've read so far and speculate about how it might have been different if the work had been written by a woman rather than a man. (There is no right or wrong answer: let your imagination take you somewhere. Would the characters be different? The plot? The ending? How does the author's gender impact his or her art?)</p>
<p class="style14">Question 3:<span class="style4"> List 3 elements of <a href="222Modernism.html">modernism</a> that you can find in our example of Virginia Woolf's fiction<em>,</em> the very short story<em>,  An Unwritten Novel</em></span><span class="style32"><em>.<br />

  Now answer your own question, or another student's, based on the whole story. How might we interpret the <em>Metamorphosis</em> through the lens of Formalist, Marxist, Feminist&hellip; criticism? Think especially about the violin scene, the death scene and the final paragraph.<br />
  <br />
  <span class="style31"><span class="style32">&bull; FORMALIST CRITICISM<br />
  <span class="style4">Why are Gregor's parents not given names but his sister is?<br />
  Could Gregor's bug-like form be the repercussions of miscommunication before his metamorphosis? How much stress is a human being capable of handling?
  </span></span></span><span class="style31"><span class="style32"><br />
  <br />
  &bull; </span></span><span class="style32">SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM<span class="style4"><br />
  Why has Gregory turned into a bug and what does it represent? </span><br />
&nbsp; Marxist Criticism<br />
<span class="style4">Does the <em>Metamophosis</em> embrace or reject socialism? </span><br />
<span class="style4">Are the characters aware or unaware of the social forces that affect their lives (in particular, Gregory)? How do these forces affect his willingness or unwillingness to work?<br />
  How do economic conditions determine the characters' lives?<br />
  Does Gregor Samsa's metamorphosis symbolize the lack of human compassion he received? With all the pressure of paying off his father's debts, did he turn into a helpless insect? <br />
</span><br />
&nbsp; Feminist Criticism<br />
<span class="style4">The story emphasizes how Gregory was the breadwinner for his family. How much do you think society has accepted women in the workplace or as breadwinners for families? Do you believe that women are still to this day not able to provide for a family? Why or why not? </span><br />
&bull; 
    CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICSM<br />
    <span class="style4">How does this story represent the literary era in which it was written, and what is different in this story from most of the others we have read?<br />
    How does Gregor's attitude towards life reflect the time period in which Kafka wrote this story?<br />
  How do you think Gregor's metamorphosis into a bug represents the time period in which this book was written? </span><br />
  <br />
&bull; 
  PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM<br />
  <span class="style4">How does this work directly relate to Franz Kafka's life and relationships with his family?<br />
  How does the Metamoprhosis reflect Kafka's own relationship with people and in particular, his family? <br />
  What relevance does this story have to Kafka's life before he wrote this story?<br />
  What do the characters' emotions and behavior reveal about their psychological states? What types of personalities are they?<br />
What do Gregor's actions and emotions tell us about his psychological state?  <br />
Did Kafka write this story seeing himself as the giant bug in his father's eyes?</span></span><br />
Judging by Gregor's first thoughts upon awakening in his new body and from the ways in which he reacts, what do you think about his psychological state and his personality? Does his psychological state and personality change as time passes and he adjusts to his new form?<br />
Is Gregory really a bug or is it all a dream?<br />
What do you think Gregor's mother means when she says, &quot;I believe the best thing would be to try to keep the room exactly how it was, then when Gregory returns to us, he will find everything the same&hellip;(1984)? 
</p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style32">&bull;
  READER RESPONSE CRITICISM</span><br />
  How do you respond to the work?<br />
  Is the family's reaction to Gregor's tranformation what you would expect? How would you react if this happened to one of your family members?
  <br />
  <br />
  <span class="style32">&bull; ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM</span><br />
How does the depiction of Gregor as an insect affect the tone and overall theme of the story?<br />
How is Gregor impacted by his environment as a bug? Is the environment at fault for Gregor's struggles or can we blame Gregor for not fitting in to his environment?<br />
How do the environmental conditions of animals affect the plot?

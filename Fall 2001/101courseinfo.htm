  AND PREREQUISITES</b>: There are no pre-requisites for this course, but it is 
  a course for beginners. Students who have had one or more years of high school 
  French are requested to take the computerized NCSU Placement Test at the Foreign 
  Language Technology Center (212 Laundry Bldg.). The test will take 20-25 minutes 
  and you will receive the results immediately. <br>
  <b><br>
  WELCOME TO FRENCH! </b>This course aims at giving you a solid foundation in 
  understanding, speaking, reading and writing the French language at the elementary 
  level. To accomplish these goals, it is essential that we use French as the 
  language of the classroom. Here are some useful phrases for communicating in 
  class:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><i>R&eacute;p&eacute;tez, 
  s'il vous pla&icirc;t.</i> = Repeat, please.<br>
  <i>Comment dit-on</i> [English word]? = How do you say [English word] in French.?<br>
  <i>Que veut dire </i>[French word]?= What does [French word] mean ?<br>
  <i>Qu'est-ce que c'est</i>? = What's that?<br>
  <i>Je ne sais pas.</i> = I don't know.<br>
  <i>Je ne comprends pas.</i> = I don't understand.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">I 
  will do my best to keep the class atmosphere creative, lively, and accepting 
  of your best efforts. In return, you, too have some responsibilities. Please 
  read carefully and follow the information and advice given below<br>
  <br>
  <b>GRADING</b>: Your grade in this course will be computed as follows:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Participation, 
  class work 25%<br>
  Homework, quizzes, and film 25%<br>
  Three Exams 25%<br>
  Departmental Common Final Exam 25%</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">There 
  will be plus/minus grading in this class. The scale will be as follows:<br>
  A+ = 97.0-100, A = 93.0-96.9, A- = 90.0-92.9, B+ = 87.0-89.9, B =83.0-86.9, 
  B- = 80.0-82.9, C+ = 77.0-79.9, C =73.0-76.9, C- = 70.0-72.9, D+ = 67.0-69.9, 
  D = 63.0-66.9, D- = 60.0-62.9, F= 59.9 and below.<br>
  <br>
  <b>ATTENDANCE REGULATIONS:</b> Attendance is required and will be taken daily. 
  You can make progress in your language learning only if you hear and speak the 
  language regularly. You are permitted two absences in a class taught Tuesday/ 
  Thursday with no penalty. <b>Each additional absence will reduce your class 
  participation grade by one grade (from A to A-, from B+ to B, etc.).</b> See 
  me as soon as possible after your absence and provide a <b>written</b> excuse 
  to be accepted at my discretion (in case of illness, injury, death or illness 
  in the family, university duties, court attendance, or religious observance.) 
  This policy is based upon the University Attendance Policy. Save your absences 
  for emergencies. Excessive absences may lead to an F for the course.<br>
  <br>
  If you need to miss a class for one of the reasons listed above, let me know 
  before the class meeting, if possible. Upon your return to class after an absence, 
  you are responsible for all work missed and for any assignments announced during 
  your absence. I suggest that you get the name and phone number of a classmate 
  to call in the event that you are unsure of an assignment.<br>
  <br>
  E<b>XAMS AND QUIZZES</b>: There will be quizzes throughout the semester and 
  three class-long exams, in addition to a departmental final exam. There will 
  be no make-up quizzes. However, your lowest quiz grade will not count. Make-up 
  for exams will be granted only if you are excused in advance with proper documentation. 
  <br>
  &#149; The oral part of the final exam will be given during the last week of 
  classes before final exams. Note the dates on the syllabus. <br>
  <br>
  <b>HOMEWORK:</b> Each chapter of the textbook is divided into two parts: 1)<i> 
  Activit&eacute;s et lectures</i> followed by the <i>Vocabulaire</i> section 
  (white pages) and 2) the <i>Grammaire</i> <i>et exercices</i> pages (blue pages). 
  <br>
  <br>
  Before each class, you need to prepare the following:<br>
  <br>
  1) Read and write out the exercises in the appropriate sections of the blue 
  pages. Check your work using a pen or pencil in a different color and the Answer 
  Key in Appendix D of the text book (p. 435). In the margin, jot down any questions 
  you have as you correct your work.<br>
  <br>
  2) Do the written and oral exercises assigned in the <i>Cahier</i>. Exercises 
  with a cassette symbol and exercises with a video-cassette symbol are to be 
  completed with the tapes available in the Foreign Language Technology Center 
  (212 Laundry Bldg.) Correct your workbook exercises using the Answer Key at 
  the end of the <i>Cahier</i>. All exercises should be corrected clearly in a 
  different color. Mark any sections you don't understand so that you can ask 
  about them in class or I can explain when I'm correcting your work. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Due dates for homework (both written and lab exercises) are listed on the 
  syllabus. Full credit will be given only for corrected work turned in on time.</b> 
  <br>
  <br>
  We will cover the two preliminary chapters and chapters 1-5 in FLF 101.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> <b>EXTRA 
  CREDIT</b>: You can earn extra credit towards your participation grade by turning 
  supplementary assignments related to our class work, such as seeing French films 
  and using the <i>Deux Mondes</i> CD-ROM. Details will be announced in class.<br>
  <br>
  <b>LANGUAGE LAB: </b>The audio cassette listening program is coordinated with 
  the textbook and the <i>Cahier. </i>The homework assignments are listed on your 
  syllabus. You have two options for completing these exercises. You may go to 
  the Foreign Language Technology Center and listen to the tape there while completing 
  the exercises in the <i>Cahier, </i>or you may have the tape copied to listen 
  to at home. To do so, bring one or two 90-minute blank tapes of good quality 
  (TDK, Maxell, Sony) to the Language Lab and indicate which lesson you wish recorded. 
  You will be told when you can pick up the recorded lesson. Copyright restrictions 
  forbid your taping all of the lessons at once. You will therefore use the same 
  one or two audio tapes for the entire semester; succeeding lessons are taped 
  over the previous ones. You must ask for tape series <b>1AJ. </b><br>
  <br>
  Exercises in the <i>Cahier</i> with a video-cassette symbol are to be completed 
  by using the <i>Video to Accompany Deux Mondes</i> available in the Foreign 
  Language Technology Center. The Center is open Monday-Thursday 8 AM-9 PM, Friday 
  8 AM-5 PM, Saturday 12-4 PM, and is closed on Sunday.<br>
  <br>
  <b>CD</b>: The CD-ROM for <i>Deux Mondes</i> (3rd edition) provides additional 
  activities for practice and review. Completing these activities will help you 
  master new vocabulary, improve your reading skills, and learn about French and 
  francophone culture. The video clips will improve your comprehension skills. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>SUPPLEMENTAL COMPUTER EXERCISES</b>: The Foreign Language Technology Center 
  in Room 212 Laundry has additional computer-based exercises for students who 
  wish further language practice. I can also provide supplementary exercises for 
  grammar points you don't understand.<br>
  <b><br>
  FILM</b>: You are required to see <i>La Gloire de mon p&egrave;re,</i> a French 
  film with English subtitles. See your syllabus for dates and times. <br>
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">HONOR 
  CODE</font></b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">: The Foreign 
  Language Department takes the University Policy on Academic Integrity very seriously. 
  If you do not already have the pamphlet explaining this NCSU policy, ask your 
  advisor for one. In accordance with this policy, you will be required to sign 
  the Honor Pledge on every test and quiz that you take in this class. The Honor 
  Pledge reads: &quot;I have neither given nor received any unauthorized aid on 
  this test.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  <b>TUTORING ASSISTANCE</b>: Academic Support Services in Room 147 Leazar Hall 
  (near the Bell Tower) offers free tutoring beginning the third week of the semester. 
  Please see me right away if you are experiencing problems or if reasonable accommodation 
  needs to be made in the case of hearing, visual, motor, or learning disabilities. 
  I'm always available if you need help.<br>
  <br>
  <b>STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES</b>: All students currently registered with Disability 
  Services for Students (DSS) must provide each faculty member with an accommodation 
  letter. This letter verifies that appropriate medical documentation is on file 
  and that the student has a substantiated disability requiring effective reasonable 
  accommodations. Any student requesting accommodations without this letter must 
  see a DSS counselor in Suite 1900, Student Health Center. Students with disabilities 
  who possess an accommodation letter from DSS should schedule an appointment 
  with the instructor immediately. <br>
  DSS services can be found at their web site at <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/equal_op/dss/">http://www.ncsu.edu/equal_op/dss/</a> 
  or call the office directly at 919-515-7653. <br>

  CLUB</b>: Consider joining the French Club. You will get extra exposure to the 
  language. I will let you know when the meetings will take place.<br>
  <br>
  <b>SUMMER PROGRAM IN LILLE, FRANCE</b>: The Department of Foreign Languages 
  and Literatures sponsors a summer study abroad program in Lille, France where 
  you can earn a total of six credits in French for five weeks of study in May 
  and June. Please ask me for more information or inquire at the Office of Study 
  Abroad in 2118 Pullen Hall. <br>

  <b>HOW TO DO WELL IN CLASS: </b><br>
  1. Prepare all your assignments before coming to class so that we can devote 
  our in-class sessions to communicative activities rather than the learning of 
  simple grammar rules. The auditory listening program in the Language Lab is 
  also particularly important in this regard. Assignments are due for class on 
  the day indicated on the syllabus. Don't get behind or allow yourself to remain 
  confused.<br>
  <br>
  2. ACTIVELY participate in each lesson. Mentally answer each and every question 
  by practicing each answer under your breath while a classmate is responding. 
  <br>
  <br>
  3. TAKE RISKS!! Speak out. Don't be afraid to make mistakes. The more you speak, 
  the better you will get.<br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><br>
  4. Speak French in the classroom. Speak French outside the classroom at every 
  opportunity. <br>
  <br>
  5. Do not chew gum in class. Having something in your mouth makes it harder 
  to use correct pronunciation.<br>
  <br>
  5. Enjoy your language learning. Be playful and participate in games, skits, 
  etc. <br>
  <br>
  6. TAKE NOTES. Write down everything from the blackboard. If you don't have 
  enough time in class to get everything down, I will be happy to share materials 
  with you after class or in my office.</font></p>

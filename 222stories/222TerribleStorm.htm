<p class="style1">The Terrible Storm</p>
<p class="style1">Dark clouds rolled in, dark as a coal miners face, dark as a midnight sky, dark as the depths of a cave. Darker still as time passed, dark like night, dark like chocolate, and the sky was black. Temperatures unseasonably cold for the summer day sent a chill that cut through all in attendance. The weather did not diminish the turnout, everyone who lived within a days ride was present, this was important. A clasp of thunder rumbled in the distance.</p>
<p class="style1">&ldquo;Was that thunder?&rdquo; asked Homais, &ldquo;perhaps you should pray for good weather on this day of infamy.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="style1">&ldquo;Come now, I am sure the Lord Our Savior has more pressing issues than the weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="style1">&ldquo;Really now, what is more important then the Legion d&rsquo;honneur? Furthermore what is more important than the grand cordon? Today I will join the ranks of the elite, a grand cordon, one of only 75 men. What else could be more pressing to God then that?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="style1">The crowds swelled and the clouds darkened, this was the most people this town had seen in recent memory. It soon became apparent that the ceremony must be taken outside to accommodate the massive numbers. </p>
<p class="style1">&ldquo;All these people here to pay tribute to me&rdquo;, said Homais, &ldquo;but really there should be more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="style1">&ldquo;This is the most people I have seen in my life in our town&rdquo;, said the elderly man, &ldquo;you have brought honor and prestige to Yonville.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="style1">I have brought honor and prestige to myself; the town is lucky to have me, Homais quietly thought.</p>
<p class="style1">The mayor inquired, &ldquo;Perhaps we should postpone to a day when the weather is more appropriate for such an occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="style1">Homais interrupted, &ldquo;No weather is going to postpone my big day. I have worked too hard and long for this moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="style1">The town square swelled, almost bursting at the seams to accommodate all the people. The ceremony started with an introductory speech from the mayor. Then before presenting the medal he opened up the floor for Monsieur Homais. </p>
<p class="style1">Homais went on and on and the clouds got darker and darker. The thunder and lightning were growing closer now and the crowd was starting to thin. Realizing the impeding danger, the mayor cut off Homais and went on to the medal presentation. Homais feeling cheated reluctantly went along.</p>
<p class="style1">The mayor gathered up the stash with the legion badge along with the star for the left chest that all grand cordons were allowed to wear. &ldquo;I now present these worldly honors to a man of honor&rdquo; </p>
<p class="style1">Boom! All of a sudden the clouds parted and the sun shone through. An albatross flew through the city, grabbing everyone&rsquo;s attention, as it was uncommon to see the bird in this non-port town. When they did look back at the speakers platform, they saw Homais, sprawled on the floor grasping for what the mayor held, yet the it was out of reach. He opened his mouth to demand it, but nothing came out. He gasped his last breath. The mayor called for help, still Homais in his final moments yearned to grab the star, to obtain his dream. Homais died right there on the stage reaching, with his arm eternally reaching for his crowning achievement, an achievement never received.</p>
<p class="style1">Time passed and the truth came out about his unlicensed treatment of patients and corruption, the government rescinded the grand cordon and the practice of gaining power by immoral means was forever known as &ldquo;pulling an Homais&rdquo;. So Homais was immortalized after all in slang. So if anyone ever tells you that your pulling an Homais, it might be time to examine the path that you are on. </p>

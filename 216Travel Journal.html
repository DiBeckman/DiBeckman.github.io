<p class="class"><strong>Travel Journal</strong></p>
<p>Buy yourself a small notebook to use as a travel journal during our time in France. The purpose of the journal is for you to keep a record of your reflections on what you are doing, thinking, your experiences and impressions.Think about what you&rsquo;ll want to recall 5 or 50 years from now. (It's up to you whether you want to use a blog, a notebook, a photo album, and in what form you turn it in when we get back. A notebook is handy to carry around with you in Paris.)</p>
<p>Begin the journal with list of the 1<strong>0 Things I Want to Do in Paris</strong>. When you get back home, write about whether  you accomplished them and your thoughts about what you chose and what you did. When we get to Paris, write down your first, second and third impressions. What have you have seen that is surprising, alarming, typically French or different from the American way? Record your aha moments. What was the best and most frustrating experience of the day? Both will tell you a lot about yourself and the new culture around you. </p>
<p>Keep track of what French words you learned, what French foods you have tried, and what behavior is a mystery to you. Include a section entitled &ldquo;What I&rsquo;ve Eaten&rdquo; to be used in judging the &ldquo;Most Adventurous Eater&rdquo; contest (see below). </p>
<p>I also expect you to find your favorite <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Pastries_of_France">French pastry</a>, and write about it in your travel journal. </p>
<p>You could start a section for The 10 Most Shocking Things I Saw (Heard, Smelled) in Europe. </p>
<p>Include what you learned or remember about each walking tour. Write in your journal every day during our stay in Paris. Make the journal yours. You might include photos, drawings or ticket stubs. You will need to do the Looking Ten Times Two and Curatorial Exercise four times during our stay in Paris, once in each museum.  Ideally, you will find <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/spreadsheets/d/1NkcQj6kDMNg_gmXUZ8xWw_2YcuOJaYxfP_h4uhwpP-s/edit?usp=sharing">your four art works</a> in the museums we visit, or you may choose others. </p>
<p><strong>Grading of Travel Journal</strong> (Worth <span class="red">15%</span> of your final grade)<br />
A: Includes notable detail and depth. Substantive, probing, thoughtful. Reflects self-awareness and observation of the culture(s) around you. </p>
<p>B: Includes some detail and originality, but not enough detail or depth.</p>
<p> C and below: Superficial and predictable. Little context or reflection. </p>
<p><strong>Contests &ldquo;Most Adventurous Eater,&rdquo; decided by journal entries after the  week in Paris</strong>. You keep your own score using the following system: + 1 point for each unfamiliar food or beverage item consumed  - 1 point for each hamburger, hot dog, or American soft drink consumed. Repeats don&rsquo;t count for unfamiliar items; you get +1 point for the first time you try Brie, but not 3 points for eating it 3 times. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to ask my advice about restaurants, markets, interesting foods, etc. Winner gets a dinner for yourself and a friend at La Farm.</p>

With such a wide variety of social, political, and environmental issues around the globe, it is difficult to find your niche before getting on the ground. After literately going around the world I realized that education was my primary concern and the lack-of accessibility in Tanzania was something I could help change. Because of the intellectual freedom I was given in FL 498, I have taken my experience to the next level and founded a not-for-profit which helps send children to school in Moshi, Tanzania.

  <b>PLACEMENT AND PREREQUISITES</b>: A score of 10-21/ 165-279 on the NCSU Placement 
  Test is required. The Placement Test can be taken in the Foreign Language Technology 
  Center (214 Laundry Bldg). The test will take 20-25 minutes and you will receive 
  the results immediately. This course is designed for the student who has had 
  at least 1-2 years in high school and would like a refresher of the 101 material 
  before doing the 102 material. It is not designed for the student who has not had French 
previously. <strong>The time commitment outside of class is significant</strong>.</font></p>
<p class="style22"><strong><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENT</font></strong><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">: <strong>Foreign Language Proficiency for Graduation</strong><br>
  If eligible, upon admission to NC State, all students are notified during New Student Orientation and will receive a notation on their Automated Degree Audit (ADA) stating that they have met the university foreign language proficiency requirement &ndash; the &ldquo;equivalent&rdquo; of FL 102 / FL Elementary II &ndash; as &ldquo;FL* 100 High School *** PF.&rdquo;<br>
  <br>
  <b>LEARNING OUTCOMES</b>: At the end of this course, students will be able to:<br>
  1. use learned grammatical structures to speak and write in elementary or novice-level 
  French; <br>
  2. create written and oral sentences using learned vocabulary;<br>
  3. read French at the elementary or novice level;<br>
  4. understand spoken French at the elementary or novice level;<br>
  5. identify aspects of the cultures of the French-speaking world.<br>
  <br>
  <b>WELCOME TO FRENCH!</b> This course aims at giving you a solid foundation 
  in understanding, speaking, reading and writing the French language at the elementary 
  level. To accomplish these goals, it is essential that we use French as the 
  language of the classroom. Handy phrases for communicating in French: <br>
  <font color="#FF0000"><i>R&eacute;p&eacute;tez, s'il vous pla&icirc;t</i></font>. 
  = Repeat, please.<br>
  <font color="#FF0000"><i>Une minute, s'il vous pla&icirc;t</i></font>.= Wait 
  a minute, please.<br>
  <font color="#FF0000"><i>Comment dit-on [English word] en fran&ccedil;ais</i></font>? 
  = How do you say [English word] in French.?<br>
  <i><font color="#FF0000">Que veut dire [French word]</font></i>?= What does 
  [French word] mean ?<br>
  <font color="#FF0000"><i>Qu'est-ce que c'est?</i></font> = What's that?<br>
  <font color="#FF0000"><i>Je ne sais pas</i></font>. = I don't know.<br>
  <font color="#FF0000"><i>Je ne comprends pas</i></font>. = I don't understand.<br>
  <br>
  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although the language of instruction and interaction in my classroom is French, I do not expect you to always understand everything I am saying. Please do not hesitate to let me know when you do not understand. I will find another way of getting my point across, whether it is by paraphrasing, elaborating, or simply slowing down. <br>
  <br>
  </font>I will do my best to keep the class atmosphere creative, lively, and accepting 
  of your best efforts. In return, you, too have some responsibilities. Please 
read carefully and follow the information and advice given below. </font></p>
<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>GRADING</b>: Your grade in this course will be computed as follows: <br>
  Participation, Homework (Green pages, Lab manual, <em>English Grammar for Students of French</em>), Class Work <span class="style27">25 %</span><br>
  Quizzes, Compositions, Film Assignment, <em>Pays Francophone </em>Presentation <span class="style27">25 %</span><br>
  Exams <span class="style27">25 %</span><br>
  Final Exam <span class="style27">25 %</span><br>
  <br>
  There will be plus/minus grading in this class. The scale will be as follows:<br>
  A+ = 97.0-100, A = 93.0-96.9, A- = 90.0-92.9, <br>
  B+ = 87.0-89.9, B = 83.0-86.9, B- = 80.0-82.9, <br>
  C+ = 77.0-79.9, C = 73.0-76.9, C- = 70.0-72.9, <br>
  D+ = 67.0-69.9, D = 63.0-66.9, D- = 60.0-62.9,<br>
  F = 59.9 and below.<br>
  <br>
  <b>ATTENDENCE REGULATIONS</b>: Attendance is required and will be taken daily. 
  <span class="style22"> You are expected to arrive on time to class. Repeated tardiness will 
  affect your grade: three tardies will count as one absence.</span> Missing class will seriously hinder your ability to succeed in this class. The 
  following penalty will be applied: after three absences, your class participation 
  will be lowered one grade (from A to A-, from B+ to B, etc.) for EACH absence 
  beyond the limit. <br>
  <br>
  See me as soon as possible after an absence and provide a written excuse to 
  be accepted at my discretion (in case of illness, injury, death or illness in 
  the family, university duties, court attendance, or religious observance.) This 
  policy is based upon the University Attendance Policy at <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/academic_affairs/pols_regs/REG205.00.4.php">http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/academic_affairs/pols_regs/REG205.00.4.php</a><br>
  <br>
  If you need to miss a class for one of the reasons listed above, let me know 
  before the class meeting, if possible. Save your absences for emergencies. <strong>Excessive 
    absences may lead to an F for the course</strong>. Upon your return to class, you are 
  responsible for all work missed and for any assignments announced during your 
  absence. I suggest that you get the name and phone number or IM of a classmate 
  in the event that you are unsure of an assignment or wonder if there will be a verb quiz the day you return.<br>
  <br>
  <b>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY</b>: The Foreign Language Department takes the University Policy on Academic Integrity very seriously. If you do not already have the pamphlet explaining this NCSU policy, ask your advisor for one. In accordance with this policy, you will be required to sign the Honor Pledge on every exam that you take in this class. The Honor Pledge reads: &quot;I have neither given nor received any unauthorized aid on this test.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  Although you must complete and turn in your own work, you are encouraged to work with others in completing and preparing the above assignments outside of class, as well as some activities during class time (quizzes and tests being the principal exceptions). However, the copying or sharing of answers in or out of the classroom, from another student or from an answer key,  is in violation of the honor code. The Code of Student Conduct is located at <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/student_services/student_discipline/POL11.35.1.php">http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/student_services/student_discipline/POL11.35.1.php</a><br>
  <br>
  <b>EXAMS AND QUIZZES</b>: There will be 5-minute verbs quizzes at the <strong>beginning</strong> of class throughout the semester, announced at the previous class meeting, and five class-long exams as well as an individual oral exam at midterm and a  
  final exam, all listed on the <a href="110sysp09.html">Syllabus</a>. There will be no make-up quizzes. However, I will drop your lowest 
  quiz grade. Make-up for exams will be granted only if you are excused in advance 
  with proper documentation. <br>
  <br>
  &#149; The oral part of the final exam will be given during the last week of 
  classes before final exams. Note the dates on the syllabus. <br>
  <br>
  <b>HOMEWORK</b>: Each module of the textbook is divided into two parts: 1) White 
  Pages (<i>Th&egrave;mes, Pratiques de conversation, Perspectives 
    culturelles, &Eacute;coutons ensemble, Lecture, Expression &eacute;crite</i>) and 2) Green Pages (<i>Structures</i> <em>utiles</em>) <br>
  <br>
  Before each class, look through the white pages (column 2 of the syllabus) so you know what 
  we will be doing in class. The CDs included with your textbook correspond to sections in the white pages (look for the audio CD graphic). Listening to them will help you get used to hearing French. <br>
  <br>
  The third column in the syllabus lists selected <span class="style25"><em><font color="#990099"><strong>Lecture</strong></font></em>: <font color="#990099">reading exercises</font></span>. There are  corresponding written exercises <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">to  turn in listed on the syllabus </font>(<em>Compr&eacute;hension et int&eacute;gration; Et vous? Avez-vous compris</em>?) </font> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I will correct these for you. If you are having trouble with the reading questions, try writing out the question and translating it into English. I'll correct that, too.</font></p>
<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Your main homework is to write out the answers to exercises in the <span class="style24">green</span> pages (column 4 of the syllabus). You may choose to do the even or odd questions for each exercise. Check this work using Appendix B (page 485 in the textbook). All exercises 
  should be corrected clearly in a different color. If there are no errors, put a check mark so I know that you've corrected your work. If you have questions about an exercise, write me a note on your homework. Reminder: copying answers from the textbook or workbook answer key without trying them on your own, is not only a waste of time (what would you learn by copying?), but also an Academic Integrity violation (see above). </font><span class="style25">If you have no idea what the exercise wants you to do, it makes sense to contact me or to check  the answers to see a model of what is expected, but follow up by doing your own work. Try your best. You will never be graded on the number of errors in your homework or workbook. </span><span class="style29"><span class="style25">Mistakes are normal when you are learning. </span></span></p>
<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You will turn in the corrected 
  work from the green pages daily and all other written assignments  when 
  indicated on the syllabus. Please put the page numbers at the top of each homework assignment.<b> Full credit will be given only for corrected work turned in on time.</b> <br>
  <br>
  On your own, you will also do the  exercises in the Workbook/Lab Manual corresponding to each Module. <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All exercises should be corrected clearly in a different 
  color.  Mark any sections you don't understand so that you can ask about them 
  in class or I can explain when I'm correcting your work. </font>In the first half of the Workbook, you may do even or odd questions in each exercise, but you must do each exercise. You will normally skip <em>Synth&egrave;se</em>, as indicated on the Syllabus. I<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">n the second half of the Workbook/Lab manual, y</font>ou will need to do <strong>all</strong> the questions.  Suggested completion dates are 
  indicated on the syllabus.  Correct your Workbook/Lab Manual exercises 
  using the <a href="MotifsWB_AnswerKey.pdf">WorkbookAnswer Key pdf</a> and the <a href="Motifs 4e Lab Manual Answer Key-2.pdf">LabManualAnswer Key.pdf</a>.   <b>Bring your Workbook/Lab 
    Manual to each exam so that I can give you credit for your work. </b>You will 
  get full credit (10 points) for complete and corrected (in a different color) 
  exercises and partial credit (5 points) for uncorrected exercises or late lab work. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  <br>
  Exercises in the Lab Manual are to be completed with the audio available in 
  the Language Lab and online. See the section <b>Language Lab</b> below. </font></p>
<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On your own, you will also read and do the self-correcting exercises in <em>English Grammar for Students of French</em>. Assigned sections for each exam are listed on the <a href="110sysp09.html">Syllabus</a>. A very detailed listing of the sections which correlate to the grammar we are studying in <em>Motifs </em>is listed in the <a href="motifs.pdf">Correlation Guide pdf</a>. The completed and corrected exercises are due each exam day for full credit (5 points). <br>
  <br>
  We will cover Modules 1-11 in FLF 110. <br>
  <br>
<b>WRITTEN WORK</b>: </font></p>
<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Please <strong>skip lines</strong> on all written assignments whether handwritten or typed.<br>
  <br>
  <b>DO</b> use regular or online dictionaries to check gender, spelling, and find French 
      or English equivalents for individual words or idiomatic expressions (for example: to have a good time= <em>s'amuser</em>).  <br>
      <a href="http://www.wordreference.com/">http://www.wordreference.com/</a> (my favorite; great for idioms) <br>

<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The University of Chicago site also has a handy French verb conjugator:<br>

  <br>
  However, do <b>NOT</b> use online translators for sentences for written 
          assignments. The results are poor and will violate Academic Integrity (see above).<br>
  <br>
      <b>COMPOSITIONS</b> <i>Expression &eacute;crite </i>(in textbook) and <i>Synth&egrave;se </i>(in workbook )<br>
  You will write a double-spaced, word-processed composition for each Module, 
submitting a first draft and final version for each. The due date for the first 
draft is indicated on the syllabus. Learn to type accents on your computer. 
You will find an explanation of how to do this on the <a href="110supp.htm">Supplementary Materials</a> page.  Drafts will be returned with <a href="110CorrectionSymbols.html">corrections</a> indicated. Beginning with Module 3, I will be giving you a grade for the revised compositions. Unrevised compositions will receive a check  which corresponds to a C when I calculate the final grade. Compositions will be graded using the <a href="110writingassessment.html">Writing Assessment Rubric</a>. </font></p>
<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Please note: do not use on-line translators for writing assignments for more than individual words or phrases. <br>
  <br>
  <b>LANGUAGE LAB</b>: You have three options for obtaining the audio material needed 
  to complete the comprehension and pronunciation exercises in the Lab manual. 
  The most convenient is to<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> listen to the audio online, using WebCT. To access WebCT, go to <a href="http://vista.ncsu.edu">http://vista.nscu.edu</a> and log in with your Unity ID and password. Once logged in, you will be brought to your <b>my Courses </b> page. Beneath the Courses header you will find links to the home pages of classes in which you are enrolled that are using WebCT. Click on FLF 110. This will take you to the FL 110 home page. For your first visit to WebCT Vista, please click on the Student Orientation. Read <em>Getting Started with WebCT Vista</em>, Section 1. </font></font></p>
<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the home page, you will also find the Motifs Online Audio Icon where you can download the audio for each Module in our textbook. There is also a link for downloading RealPlayer, so you can listen to the audio. </font></p>
<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For help with WebCT Vista or RealPlayer configuration, follow the Help links on VISTA or call 515-HELP.</font></p>
<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You may also go to the Foreign Language Technology Center and listen to the audio 
  on the computers there while completing the exercises in the Lab Manual, or you may have the 
  material copied on to a cassette tape to listen to at home. To do so, bring 
  one or two 90-minute blank tapes of good quality (TDK, Maxell, Sony) to the 
  Language Lab and indicate which Module you wish recorded. You will be told when 
  you can pick up the recorded lesson. Copyright restrictions forbid taping all 
  of the lessons at once. You will therefore use the same one or two audio tapes 
for the entire semester; succeeding lessons are taped over the previous ones. </font></p>

  <b>FILM</b>: You are required to watch one of two French films with English 
  subtitles, <i>Am&eacute;lie</i> or <i>Le D&icirc;ner de Cons</i> and complete 
  a written assignment. See your syllabus for dates and times of the film showings 
  and the assignment deadlines. The <a href="filmsheet.html">Film Study Sheet</a> should be used for this assignment and can be submitted for any other French film for extra credit. You can rent films locally and view or check them out from the Media Center in DH Hill Library. Here's how to find out which French films are in the Media Center: <br>

  HOW TO DO WELL IN CLASS</b>: <br>
  <br>
  1) <b>Prepare assignments before coming to class</b> so we can get the most 
  out of our class time together. Assignments are to be completed as indicated 
  on the syllabus. It is nearly impossible to &#147;cram&#148; for this course 
  and do well. Learning a language is like building a house of cards: each one 
  must be well in place before adding the next. I urge you to spend at least 30 
  minutes on French per day, rather than studying all at once before exams. Regular 
  repetition of small quantities of information is the most successful method 
  for learning a foreign language.<br>
  <br>
  2) <b>Participate actively</b> in each lesson. Mentally answer each and every 
  question when a classmate is responding. Class participation and homework make 
  up 25% of your grade. The more you participate, the better your grade will be, 
  and the better your French will become. Your class grade reflects your performance 
  in class (attendance, knowledge of daily lesson, volunteering answers, asking 
  questions). Take listening comprehension seriously &#151; it will help both your proficiency and your grade (there is a listening component 
  on exams). <br>
  <br>
  3) <b>Take risks</b>. Speak out. Don&#146;t be afraid to make mistakes. I am 
  here to help. The more you speak, the more you will get out of the class. Save perfection for exams. The desire to communicate is the most important 
  consideration when speaking. <br>
  <br>
  4) <b>Speak French as much as possible</b> in the classroom. Speak French outside 
  the classroom whenever possible, too. Listen to French music, go to French movies, 
  eat French food!<br>
  <br>
  5) <b>Bring textbook to class every day</b>. This is essential. You should also 
  purchase a decent quality French/English-English/French dictionary. While not 
  required, it will help you find words not explained in the textbook. <br>
  <br>
  6) <b>Take notes</b> in class whenever appropriate. Buy 3x5 notecards to make 
  personalized verb charts and other study aids. Study with a friend
  outside of class. <br>
  <br>
  I look forward to a pleasant and productive semester! Don't hesitate to ask 
  me for help and assistance in person or by email.<br>
  <br>
  My personal teaching philosophy is reflected in this quotation from educator 
  Haim Ginnott (1922-1973):<br>
&#147;It&#146;s my personal approach that creates the climate. It&#146;s my 
  daily mood that makes the weather. As a teacher, I possess a tremendous power 
  to make a student&#146;s life miserable or joyous. I can be a tool of torture 
  or an instrument of inspiration. I can humiliate or humor, hurt or heal. In 
  all situations, it is my response that decides whether a crisis will be escalated 
  or deescalated and a student humanized or dehumanized.&#148; </font></p>

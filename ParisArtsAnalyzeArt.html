<p class="style2">WHAT TO CONSIDER WHEN LOOKING AT A WORK OF ART</p>
<p class="style1">There are four basic parts to an analysis:</p>
<p class="style2"> 1. Description&hellip;what you see and know about the work</p>
<p class="style1">&bull;	What is its size?<br />
  &bull;	What materials or media are employed?<br />
  &bull;	Were any special techniques used to make this work? <br />
  &bull;	What is the date of the work&rsquo;s creation?  Where was it created?<br />
  &bull;	Where is it now?  Who owns it? <br />
  &bull;	What is the title of the work?<br />
  &bull;	Is it a landscape, portrait, still-life, genre, religious, history, mythological work?<br />
  &bull;	What is the subject matter or theme?  (e.g.  a statue of Apollo, a crucifixion, a church)<br />
  &bull;	Describe this theme if it has a textual source (e.g.  Apollo is the mythical god of the sun)<br />
  &bull; Take an inventory of what you see.  List everything that is in front of you.<br />
  &bull;	Describe the basic imagery (e.g.  there are 3 female figures standing on a hill with the sun setting behind them)<br />
  &bull;	Who is the artist or architect?   When &amp; where did they live/work?<br />
  &bull;	What do you know about the artist?<br />
  &bull;	At what point in the artist&rsquo;s career was the work produced?</p>
<p class="style2">2. Formal Analysis&hellip;the design of the work (how is it constructed?)</p>
<p class="style1">For two-dimensional works:<br />
  &bull;	What element or elements seem to dominate?<br />
  &bull;	Is color important?<br />
  &bull;	What colors are used?  Warm (red-yellow-orange) or cool (violet-green-blue)?<br />
  &bull;	How are the colors arranged?<br />
  &bull;	Does the artist change the value and intensity of the colors?<br />
  &bull;	Do the colors affect one another?  Do the colors advance and recede?<br />
  &bull;	Is line an important element?<br />
  &bull;	Are forms organized on a flat plane or are they set deep into space?  How does the artist achieve this?  (overlapping, diminution, perspective?)<br />
  &bull;	How is depth created?  Is it shallow or deep?<br />
  &bull;	Describe the texture (smooth, shiny, matte, rough).  How would you describe the brushwork?<br />
  &bull;	Is there the illusion of texture?  Do the materials create actual texture?<br />
  &bull;	What shapes predominate?<br />
  &bull;	How is the composition balanced, asymmetrically or symmetrically?<br />
  &bull;	Is there a focal point?  How is it created?<br />
  &bull;	Are there elements of the work that repeat?  What does the repetition do to the arrangement?<br />
  &bull;	What elements are in contrast?  How does this contrast affect the composition?</p>
<p class="style1">Additional points of consideration for three-dimensional works:<br />
  &bull;	Is the piece designed to be seen in the round or from a specific point or points?<br />
  &bull;	Is it part of a larger whole, such as a sculpture on a building or monument?<br />
  &bull;	How does light affect how it is seen?<br />
  &bull;	Is it an open or closed form?</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>3.  Interpretation:  What does the work mean?</strong><br />
  &bull;	What does the work &ldquo;say&rdquo; to you personally?<br />
  &bull;	What is your subjective reaction to the work of art?<br />
  &bull;	How has the artist used the elements of composition (line, color, shape, texture, space) to create meaning or content?<br />
  &bull;	What ideas does it put forth?<br />
  &bull;	Does the imagery present an allegorical story?<br />
  &bull;	Are symbols used?  Are there metaphors?  Discover the iconography of the work.<br />
  &bull;	What is the function of this work of art?  Who might the audience or buyer be for this piece?<br />
  &bull;	What connection do you see between subject matter and the techniques used?<br />
  &bull;	What is the cultural meaning and context of the work?<br />
  &bull;	How does the work reflect the social, political, aesthetic, or cultural ideas of its time?<br />
  &bull;	How do others react to this work?  How do they interpret it?<br />
</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>4.  Conclusion:  evaluate the work in terms of other historical models</strong><br />
  &bull;	How does the piece compare with other works by this artist?<br />
  &bull;	If it is described as a particular style, what about it distinguishes the style?  (e.g. what makes a Monet painting an Impressionist painting?)</p>

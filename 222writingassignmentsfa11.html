  <h2 class="class">Class 2 (Pope, Lecture 1) <span class="date">due Friday, August 19</span></h2>
  <p> Read the argument (summary) and first stanza of Pope's <span class="text">Essay on Man</span>. Write a page about the first stanza (lines 1-16) answering Shannon's 4 questions*.</p>
  <ol class="unspaced">
    <li>What is confusing?</li>
    <li>What is repeated?</li>
    <li>What is familiar?</li>
    <li>What is strange?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>*This and all subsequent references to Shannon are from Edward Shannon's <span class="text">The Prentice Hall Guide to Writing about Literature</span> (Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2002) which went out of print in 2010. I  replaced it with <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> as a textbook for our class.</p>
  <p> Print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222Enlightenment.html">The Enlightenment</a> and <a href="222GreatChain.html">The Great Chain of Being</a></p>
  <p>Write a one-paragraph to one-page summary of Chapter 1 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>. Include the main points and any others that seem especially helpful or surprising to you. Some students prefer to an outline format. Outlining and summarizing are both useful skills. You may write or type it, and you may include it on the same page with your discussion of the first stanza of <span class="text">Essay on Man.</span></p>
  <p>In addition, for this and the next assignment, take a look at  my web page on <a href="Explication.html"><em>Explication de Texte</em></a> and these web sites about figures of speech which are also listed on the handy <a href="222supmatf04.html">Supplementary Materials</a> page. These pages will  be useful for your <a href="222poetrypresentation.html">Poetry Presentation</a> due in <span class="date">September 9 and 12</span>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Here is <a href="http://grammar.about.com/od/terms/a/revquiz20terms.htm?p=1">a quiz</a> you can take to assess your knowledge of the &quot;Top 20 figures of speech&quot; by Richard Norquist.</li>
    <li> <a href="http://www.nipissingu.ca/faculty/williams/figofspe.htm">This site</a> contains figures of speech, thought, repetition, more than you can shake a stick at! Most examples are drawn from Shakespeare. </li>
    <li> <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/rhetoricaldevicesinsound.htm">This site</a> is very cool because it has sound clips and draws from a wide range of speeches, movies, and more to illustrate the Figures of Speech. For example, see and listen to quotes from Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln, and Neil Armstrong on <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/figures/antithesis.htm">the page about antitheses</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="class">Class 3 (Pope, Lecture 2) <span class="date">due Monday, August 22</span></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Print out <a href="AcademicIntegrityPledge.html">Academic Integrity form</a>. Please sign, date, and turn in. </li>
    <li>Read <span class="text">Essay on Man</span> and write a page about your stanza to turn in. In case you're not sure what a <em>stanza</em> is, you can look this and other literary terms up in our course <a href="222Glossary.html">Glossary</a>, the Glossary in Appendix B of <span class="text">A Short Guide to Writing About Literature</span>, or a web site such as <a href="http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms.html">http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms.html</a>. <br />
      <br />
      Note that the Roman numerals I-X at the beginning of each stanza correspond to your assigned stanza number (not a page or line number). What is the stanza about? Give a one sentence summary. Answer the Shannon's 4 questions. Also, what are the key words and images in the stanza? How does the stanza connect with the ideas of the Enlightenment we've discussed? What is  the attitude of the narrator? What is the role of nature, especially animals, if any appear in your stanza?</li>
    <li>Write a one-paragraph to one-page summary or outline of Chapter 2 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> to turn in. </li>

      <h2 class="class">Class 4 (Voltaire, Lecture 1) <span class="date"> due Wednesday, August 24</span></h2>
      <ol class="spaced">
        <li> Print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222ShortStoryNovel.html">Different Forms of Prose Fiction</a>; <a href="222SatireIronyUtopia.html">Satire, Irony and Utopia</a>. Read <a href="222Panglossian.htm">Panglossian</a>. </li>

        <li>Consider bookmarking an online dictionary, such as <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/">dictionary.com</a> or <a href="http://www.m-w.com/">Merriam-Webster</a> to make it easy to look up words you don't know. If you are doing the Reading Notebook, you can print out the definitions to include in your notebook. Do you like words or want to improve your vocabulary (GRE in your future?)? I recommend that you sign up for the free edition of Anu Gang's email <a href="http://wordsmith.org/awad/subscribe.html">A Word a Day</a>.</li>
      </ol>
<h2 class="class">Class 5 (Voltaire, Lecture 2) <span class="date">due Friday, August 26</span></h2>
      <ol>
        <li> Discuss the following questions after you do the reading assignment (Chapters 14-22). Quote from the text with examples to support your answers and include the page reference for each quotation.
          <ul>
            <li>Is Eldorado a genuine utopia or (in one critic's words) &quot;a colossal bore&hellip;satirized by Voltaire as foolish and futile&quot;?</li>
            <li>Which specific behaviors or institutions show us that Voltaire wants the reader to see Eldorado as utopic?</li>
            <li>Does Voltaire have a philosophical lesson in mind or is it pure satire? Or both?</li>
            <li>How does it correspond to your personal view of Utopia?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>See Lecture Notes on <a href="222dulce.html">Dulce et utile</a>.</li>
        <li>Read Chapter 3 in <em>A Short Guide</em> and write a summary or outline to turn in.</li>
        <li>The first original contribution post&mdash;on Pope&mdash;is due <span class="date">Friday, August 26</span> at midnight. You will have many authors to choose from to do your required 13 posts (7 original contributions and 6 responses), but I encourage you to get in the habit of posting by starting with Pope or Voltaire. For an original contribution post, make a point or develop an argument of at least one  full paragraph (5-8 sentences) based on something you read, learned or thought while reading <em>An Essay on Man</em>. Ask a question or make a provocative statement for your classmates to respond to. You may also include a quote from the text under discussion or links to other web sites. Did something in your homework get praise or a lot of comment from me? If so, it might be the basis of a good post. 
          <h2><span class="class">Class 6 (Voltaire, Lecture 3)</span> <span class="date">due Monday, August 29</span></h2>
          <p>Read the page in Supplementary Materials, <a href="Candide%20quotes.html">Quotes from different critics about &quot;Il faut cultiver notre jardin.&quot;</a> Write a page which includes answers to the following questions: what are some  literal and figurative meanings of the word <em>garden</em>? How do they apply to Candide's garden? How do <strong>you</strong> interpret the final line of the story? </p>
          <p>To help you to understand the difference between <strong>literal</strong> and <strong>figurative</strong>, here is  an example I found online:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>literal</strong> vs. <strong>figurative</strong> meaning - relates to the meanings of words and phrases or expressions. For example, &quot;She was all ears&quot; has a <strong>figurative</strong> meaning (She was listening intently) as well as a <strong>literal</strong> meaning (Her body was composed of ears or she had a huge set of ears). <span class="citation"><a href="http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm">Literary Terms for English</a></span></p>

        <li>Choose any one of the following questions to answer and include the question with your answer. These questions would also inspire some good discussions in your Moodle posts.</li></ol>
      <div class="maroon">
        <h3>FORMALIST CRITICISM:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>What do you think about Flaubert's usage of description? Are his descriptions just right or is he inundating the reader with unnecessary details?</li>
          <li>This story uses a third-person omnisicent point of view. Would any other point of view be sufficient for this or any other realist story? Explain why or why not.</li>
          <li>How does Flaubert use irony throughout <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> regarding Emma's love life and her love for romanticism?</li>
        </ul>
</div>
      <h3>SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
<div class="red">
  <h4>Marxist Criticism:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Is Emma's deep desire to be a part of the higher class a reflection of her need for attention?</li>
    <li>Is Emma's longing for life in the upper class, as well as the small and teasing tastes of it the author's way of making fun of class structure? Or simply to draw the reader's attention to it?</li>
    <li>What tone is set in portraying class difference in <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> and how is it shown?</li>
    <li>Is Flaubert trying to portray that even though our society is evolving toward classes of the very rich and the very poor, or does a definitive middle class still exist?</li>
    <li>How important are the economic factors in a character's life in determining the social status of the individual in addition to determining how the character is viewed by others? How is this idea changed by the influx or loss of economic status?</li>
    <li>Do you think that if the social and economic classes were cut out of Madame Bovary, that the book would be too greatly reduced, if not obsolete? </li>
  </ul>
  </div>
<div class="purple">
  <h4>Feminist Criticism: </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>It seems as if Flaubert sees financial situations a matters to be the burden of a man, and a task which women cannot easily handle. What other story written close to this time also portrays this idea? Also what is Flaubert's objective in making Emma so materialistic and &quot;man-like?&quot;</li>
    <li>Her seeming desire to be a man seems to drive her relationships, but does being a man have anything to do with being free?</li>
    <li>Does her treatment of her daughter on page 1105 make her seem somehow less feminine? Or even human?</li>
    <li>Why does she reject her female role so fiercely? A desire to explore? For money? Or something else?</li>
    <li>When she finds out she is pregnant, why is she only excited to buy things, not for her child?</li>
    <li>As a woman living in a very gender-divided society, how does Emma possess power?<br />
    </li>
  </ul>
  </div>
      <div class="teal">
        <h3>CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Based on the actions and bahviors of Emma, Charles, and Homais, how does Flaubert potray the period of French history known as the &quot;July Monarchy'? What does this say about Flaubert's attitude toward the Bourgeoisie and their impact on this period of French history? Looking at French history, what was the extent of the impact of the bourgeoisie on French culture, aside from Flaubert's opinions?</li>
          <li>How much is the time Emma lived in to blame for all her problems? Specifically, what are some examples of the type of society she lived in that influenced her actions?</li>
          <li>If the story behind <em>Madame Bovary</em> had occured during a later time period, today for example, do you think Emma would have acted differently? Why or why not?</li>
          <li>Is Emma's behavior the norm of this period or is it something only limited to her due to her upbringing?</li>
          <li>Flaubert's <em>Madame Bovary</em> is set in 19th century France. How does the novel reflect this time period? Also, the culture of France plays a very important part of the plot of the novel. Do you think the novel would be different had it been set in another country, for example, America?</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
<div class="orange">
  <h3>PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Psychologically, how can you describe Emma's state of being? Do you think there is one psychological element from Emma's personality that stands out from these in your previous answer?</li>
    <li>What events in Emma's life do you suppose led her to constantly desire change?</li>
    <li>Throughout the story we often see Emma struggling with her emotions when it comes to love. Things don't work out with her and Charles, her and Rodolphe, or her and Leon. It is clear that Emma deeply desires to have love of the kind that she reads about in her romantic novels. <em>Do you think Emma really wants to find that kind of love one day, in the form of a companion? Or would she really be more content with just the thought of love?</em> Maybe she feels that in her mind she can have it the way she wants, without a man doing something to mess things up.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
<div class="blue">
  <h3>READER RESPONSE CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> As Emma and Leon's romantic affair flourishes behind Charle's back, how does your view of Emma change? Do you feel sorry for her because she can't openly be with the one she loves or do you dislike her and think what she is doing to Charles is wrong?</li>
    <li>Do you think that Emma's attitude toward country life is sympathetic at all? How about her attitude towards the members of her family, especially Charles and Berthe? How does the synthesis of these two attitudes make you as the reader feel about Emma as a person?</li>
          <li>Do your past experiences or thoughts and interpretations of other works influence your interpretation or expectations of this work?</li>
    <li>Does anyone in your life remind you of Emma? Why?</li>
    <li>Instead of judging Emma for her marital infidelity and apathetic attitude for accumulating debt, put yourself in her shoes. For the lackluster, unexciting treatment given to her by Bovary and the other men's lustful attraction to her, is it truly wrong for her to act this way? Would it be surprising for any of us to act in this same manner? In any underlying way, isn't Flaubert giving an excuse for her actions by showing the lackluster treatment from the other citizens?</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
<div class="green">
  <h3>ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>What significance do you think nature has had on Madame Bovary? Does she yearn for nature like the romantic poets or during the Enlightenment period? Does the fact that she grew up surrounded by nature show anything about how she wanted to live life?</li>
    <li>Gustave Flaubert is metaphor heavy when it comes to comparing people with animals, farm animals in particular. How does the extended metaphor, people are like farm animals, affect the theme(s) of <span class="text">Madame Bovary?</span></li>
    <li>How do Emma's dreams of her perfect romantic environment contrast with her real &quot;dull countryside, imbecile petty bourgeois, life in its ordinariness&quot; environment?</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
<div class="fuchsia">
  <h3>QUEER THEORY: </h3>
  <ul>
          <li>How does the cross between sex and experience (or inexperience) define Charles, Emma, Leon and Rodophe respectively?</li>
          <li>If sex hadn't been such a casual thing in these times, would Emma have reached the same fate?</li>
          <li>Are the affairs Emma participates in reprehensible or justified since her husband could not satisfy her needs?</li>
          <li>Does anyone else think that the relationship between Emma and her admirers is defined through their sex lives? With Charles being so inexperienced and without love it show how little Emma cares about their relationship working. While she and Rodolphe have a very sexual relationship just because she was so interested in his money and the prospect of living with him on the &quot;good side of life.&quot; Do you think Flaubert was provoking the open sexuality of some women and how their relationships were based on the money side of life?</li>
          <li>How would the promiscuity of Emma while married be viewed or punished by the church compared as compared to if she was not promiscuous but simply in love with another woman instead in that time period? Which would be worse?</li></ul></div>

    <p>Now answer your own question, or another student's (see below), based on the <strong>whole</strong> story. In other words, how might we interpret the <span class="text">Metamorphosis</span> through the lens of Formalist, Marxist, Feminist&hellip; criticism? Think especially about the violin scene, the death scene and the final paragraph.    </p>
    <p>For fun, <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~ljordan/metamorphosis/"> check out</a>: Which character are you in The Metamorphosis? </p>
<p>&quot;We are all sentenced to solitary confinement inside our own skins, for life.&quot; Williams, Tennessee. Recommended reading: two articles  relate to what I'll call <a href="222Isolationandcontact.html">The Gerasim Effect</a>&mdash;<span class="text">The United States holds tens of thousands of inmates in long-term solitary confinement. Is this torture?</span> by Atul Gawande  and <span class="text">Comforter and Comforted in an Unfolding Mystery</span> by Nell Burger Kirst. These articles could lead to a potential paper topic.    </p>
<div class="maroon">
  <h3>FORMALIST CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>What is the significance of the first sentence of the story?</li>
    <li>The story has a rather monotonous form; there are no page breaks, no dialogue lines, and paragraphs tend to run on for very long. Does this form, in your opinion, reflect the story in any way?</li>
    <li>How did Gregor's lack of questioning his transformation contribute to the story?</li>
    <li>What issues are raised by the work? How does the work's structure resolve those issues?</li>
    <li>Do you think Kafka could be more descriptive about Kafka's transformation to create a greater drama in the story?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h3>SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
<div class="red">
  <h4>Marxist Criticism:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>How has the Samasa' financial situation affected the relationships within the family?</li>
    <li>What social class would Gregory and his family be considered a part of? Why did Gregory have to work as a traveling salesman?</li>
    <li>The abusrdity of Gregory Samsa being transformed into a bug is a figurative depiction of a person being alientated (unable to function/relate to) from his life, work or other people. In what ways does Kafka illustrate Gregory being unable to related to the society around him?</li>
    <li>How does Gregor's transformation change his famiy in economic and emotional ways now that they realize that they can't be dependent on him and in fact he is now dependent on them?</li>
    <li>How does the social class that the Samsa family is in contribute to how Gregory and his family responds to his odd change?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="purple">
  <h4>Feminist Criticism: </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Out of all of the women in the story <span class="purple">Metamorphosis, which portrays the strongest feminist beliefs?</span></li>
    <li>Up to this point, who is the most powerful character in the story besides Gregor, and why?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="teal">
  <h3>CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>In <span class="text">The Metamorphosis</span>, the main character Gregor is treated very harshly by this father for his body changing into something different and unusual to the norm. Do you think this reflects racism towards certain groups during the time?</li>
    <li>What does Gregor's constant worrying about money suggest about the time the story was published (1915)?</li>
    <li>Do you think that cultural values or supertitions (witchcraft, divine retribution, etc) play a role in the text? Why?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="orange">
  <h3>PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Why is Gregory's family so unsympathetic to his state? Do you think this reflecs how he was viewed in the family before he was an insect?</li>
    <li>How does Gregory respond to being changed into a bug and what does that say about his psychological state?</li>
    <li>After figuring out what he'd become, he foucses more on his environment and what others will think of him than he does about himself. How does this display Gregory's mentality and his values?</li>
    <li>How does the way Gregory is treated by his family make you feel about Gregory and his life? Do you feel sorry for him? Do you think his is treated unfiarly or does he deserve this treatment? Can you relate to how Gregory feels?</li>
    <li>What does this transformation mean for the character and how does this affect him emotionally?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="blue">
  <h3>READER RESPONSE CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>When Gregory turns into a bug, both he and his family have to adjust and deal with his current state. As a reader, have you ever had to deal with a major change? How did you cope and how, after experiencing this change, does this affect how you sympathize with Gregory?</li>
    <li>In the beginning of the story, Gregory wakes from his sleep to discover he has morphed into an insect for an unexplainable reason. Why do you think he (1) does not question this metamorphosis and (2) does not do anything to try to change his condition/ new form?</li>
    <li>How do you respond to Gregor's transformation?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="green">
  <h3>ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>What is the signficance pf Gregor's metamorphosis into an &quot;insect&quot; and how does this change how those around him treat him and/or his relationships to them?</li>
    <li>What significance do you think Gregory's surroundings have on his transformation? Does his transformation reflect how he feels or fits in his life?</li>
    <li>Does Gregory seem to be shrinking to anyone else? Or at least his size seems to change with his current mental situation. Do changes in his room/cell have anything to do with this?</li>
    <li>How does Gregory's phsycial transformation mimic the claustrophobic environment he is bound to in the story?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="fuchsia">
  <h3>QUEER THEORY: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>When Gregory is discovered to be a bug by his parents and office manager, they have negative reactions. Is this similar to how people react to homosexuals in society?</li>
    <li>Is the framed magazine clipping of a lady in winter clothes a clear representation of Gregor's sexuality or is it possible that it is used to cover up or hid Gregor's sexuality?</li>
    <li>How is the way in which Gregory is treated as an outcast within his family similar to the ways in which homosexuals are treated in society?</li>
  </ul>

  <li> Choose any work we've read so far and speculate about how it might have been different if the work had been written by a woman rather than a man. (There is no right or wrong answer: let your imagination take you somewhere. Would the characters be different? The plot? The ending? How does the author's gender impact his or her art?)</li>
  <li> List 3 elements of <a href="222Modernism.html">modernism</a> that you can find in our example of Virginia Woolf's fiction, the very short story, <span class="text">An Unwritten Novel</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="red"> Helpful synopsis of the story and main ideas:</span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> &quot;The narrator, while riding in a train, imagines possible characters and plots for a novel, based on her observations of another passenger whom she calls 'Minnie Marsh.' The narrative alternates between imaginative creation and objective observation, leading the narrator to unexpected discoveries about herself and the nature of art and artistic representation.&quot; <span class="citation"><a href="http://fajardo-acosta.com/worldlit/woolf/unwritten_novel.htm">Fidel Fajardo-Acosta</a></span></p></blockquote>

<h2><span class="class">Class 36 (Thesis exercise and Peer review of Term Paper) </span><span class="date">due Wednesday, November 16</span></h2>
<p>The first part of class will be devoted to <em>The Thesis Exercise</em>. Read the <a href="222Thesis exercise.html">web page</a> about how to write a thesis for a literary paper. Print and fill out the <a href="222Theses.html">page of sample FL 222 theses</a> where you rate the examples. The second half of class will be devoted to peer review of the first draft of your <a href="222Paper2010.html">Paper</a>. Print out <strong>two copies</strong> of the <a href="Peerevaluation2.pdf">Peer Review Feedback Form</a> to include with the <strong>two copies</strong> of your draft which you will bring for your classmates. Fill out the top part of the form with your name, paper title, and date. Do <strong>not wait</strong> until the last minute to print these materials out. Email me before class if you have an idea for your own original topic so that I can approve it. Speaking of original, a very creative paper where almost all the main characters meet in Hell written by a former student is featured <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~dsbeckma/To Hell with Literature.htm"> here</a>, and my favorite missing chapter of <em>Candide</em> is <a href="222VoltaireCandide.html">here</a>: </p>
<p>Selected writing advice from the <a href="222Paper2010.html">Term Paper page:</a></p>
<h3>Choose your topic</h3>
<p>Read through the topic choices below. Consult Chapter 10 in <span class="text"> A Short Guide, Writing about Fiction: the World of the Story</span>, especially the pages on &quot;Getting Ideas&quot; (171-5).  Which texts have been your favorite or challenged you the most? Send me an email or make an appointment if you need help deciding on a topic. </p>
<h3>Steps for writing </h3>
<p>Step 1: read, re-read and annotate your texts; write preliminary notes; build up to a fully formulated thesis. A thesis is a clear and specific argument, not a list, not an opinion, not an obvious fact.</p>
<p>See the <a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/course/FL/222">Library Tools</a> page to see resources available to you from NCSU libraries. </p>
<p>Step 2: Following <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>, Chapter 3; write a first draft of 1-2 pages about one of the topics below for the peer review session. It should have a working title and a fully formulated introduction (you can rewrite them later, but they need to be there for the draft) and several finished paragraphs; your audience knows the text, so you should avoid plot summaries. Use the present tense for literary analysis: Ivan <strong>is</strong> an ambitious&hellip; Flaubert <strong>reveals</strong>&hellip; Include your outline. This is the peer review draft version of your paper; print and bring 2 copies of it to class. Include the <a href="Peerevaluation2.pdf">Peer Review Feedback form</a> with each copy.</p>
<p>Some useful pages (among many) about writing:</p>
<ul>
  <li> For the difference between formal and informal style: <a href="http://www.mondofacto.com/study-skills/writing/how-to-use-academic-writing-style/04.html">http://www.mondofacto.com/study-skills/writing/how-to-use-academic-writing-style/04.html</a>.</li>
  <li>For guidelines about  commas, see <a href="http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/commas.html">http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/commas.html</a></li>
  <li>For writing anxiety or writer's block, see <a href="http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/writing_anxiety.html">http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/writing_anxiety.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. Beckman's hint about titles: A dull title sets expectations low. A good title invites the reader! Quotes, proverbs or aphorisms make great titles. Try a google search with a key word from your thesis (pride, satisfaction, quest, etc) and the word quote. I've already got a <a href="222Lovequotes.html">web page</a> with love quotes for you to use, since love is such a popular topic. </p>

<h2><span class="class">Class 40 (Paper Full Draft)</span><span class="date"> due Monday, November 21</span></h2>
<p>No class meeting, but  come to the classroom to drop off your Exquisite Corpse work of art and the complete draft of your paper along with your peer review drafts. See the <a href="222Paper2010.html">Paper</a> page for full details.
  Highlights include:</p>
<p>-Step 3: Reflect on your peer reviewers' suggestions and write a full draft of your paper to turn in to me. Proofread following the <span class="text">Editing</span> and other checklists listed on the inside cover of <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>. I will not grade the paper at this point but will return it to you with comments, so that you can write the final draft. Consult the <a href="222scoringrubric.html">Scoring Rubric for Papers</a> and <a href="222scoringrubric-rewrite.html">Scoring Rubric for Creative Papers</a> so that you'll know what I will be looking for when I do grade the paper.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Chapter 14 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> is an exellent presentation of the style and format I expect in  a literary paper. Pay attention to good organization and logical transitions between paragraphs.</li>
  <li>Base your arguments on close readings of the texts you have chosen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two areas that are normally weak in the first draft are the use of quotations and the conclusion.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Give concrete examples (quotes) from 
    the texts to support your arguments, but not to fill up space.  These quotations are the evidence you need to provide to prove your thesis. You will usually use at least one in each of body paragraphs.</li>
  <li>In order to integrate quotes appropriately, first introduce the quote by making the point, connected to your thesis, that the passage illustrates. Next, include the quote, usually 3-5 lines of text. Finally, tie the quote back into your argument with a concluding sentence in your own words: &quot;&hellip;remind your reader that these passages are there to prove a point. End your discussion on your words, not theirs.&quot; (Shannon, 162-3).</li>
</ul>
<p>A conclusion is very important to a fully developed paper. Go beyond the ideas in your introduction. Have you proved your thesis?  All readers, including your professor, will ask the question: &quot;So what?&quot; The conclusion should make the relevance and importance of your research clear.</p>
<p>You are not required to use secondary sources (books, articles, internet) for this paper, but if you do, be sure to quote and document them properly and attach a &#147;Works Cited&#148; page. <strong>Plagiarism is a poor choice and will not be tolerated</strong>; consult the <a href="222CIsp11.html">Course Information</a> page about the NC State academic integrity policy; ask me if questions remain. For information on using research (if you do) and writing the documentation page, consult <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>, chapter 15.</p>

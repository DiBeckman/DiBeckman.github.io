</a>This site is very cool because it has sound clips and draws from a wide range of speeches, movies, and more to illustrate the Figures of Speech. For example, see and listen to quotes from Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln, and Neil Armstrong on the page about antitheses: <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/figures/antithesis.htm">http://www.americanrhetoric.com/figures/antithesis.htm</a></font></span></p>

Also, what are the key words and images in the stanza? How does the verse connect with the ideas of the Enlightenment we've discussed? What is the attitude of the narrator? What is the role of nature, especially animals, if any appear in your stanza?</p>

<span class="style16"><span class="style2">1) After reading Shannon Chapter 1, write your own definition of literature to turn in. Make it as short and complete as possible.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="style7"><span class="style16">2) Write a page about the first thirteen chapters of <em>Candide</em> answering Shannon's 4 questions. </span></span></p>

<p class="style1">4) Consider bookmarking an online dictionary or two to make it easy to look up words you don't know. If you are doing the Reading Notebook, you can print out the definitions to include in your notebook. <br>

<p class="style2"><span class="style8">Class 5 (Voltaire, Lecture 2) <span class="style13">due Friday, January 20 </span><br>
      <span class="style4">Discuss the following question after you do the reading. Is Eldorado a genuine utopia or (in one critic's words) &quot;a colossal bore&hellip;satirized by Voltaire as foolish and futile&quot;? Which specific behaviors or institutions show us that Voltaire wants us to see Eldorado as utopic? Quote from the text with your examples. Does Voltaire have a philosophical lesson in mind or is it pure satire? Or both?</span></span></p>
<p class="style2">The first original contribution post&mdash;on Pope&mdash;is due Friday at midnight. You will have many authors to choose from to do your required 13 posts (7 original contributions and 6 responses), but I encourage you to get in the habit of posting by starting with Pope or Voltaire. For an original contribution post, make a point or develop an argument of at least 7 lines based on something you read, learned or thought while reading An Essay on Man. It can be helpful to ask a question or make a provocative statement for your classmates to respond to. </p>

<p class="style2"><span class="style21"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>formalist:</strong><br>
      <span class="style4">&bull; There are a lot of characters in <em>Madame Bovary. </em>Some are on stage most of the time and some aren't. How does Flaubert tie all of these characters together? Could he have cut someone out and still have made a similar impact? <br>
      &bull; What are some of the most important symbols in <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Madame Bovary</em></font></span></font></span> and how do they affect the main characters?<br>
      &bull; In the last several chapters of Part One, how do the description and portrayal of Madame Bovary set up what is to become her life in Part Two?<br>
      &bull; How does the title of the work relate to the three Madame Bovarys in the story? Why did Flaubert pick <em>Madame Bovary</em> as a title? </p>
<p class="style2"><span class="style21"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Marxist: </strong><br>
  <span class="style4">&bull; How do Emma's hopes of transcending her way of life clash with the bourgeois class?<br>
  &bull; There are clear class differences in <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Madame Bovary</em></font>. Does Madame Bovary feel she will find true love if she is a <em>have</em> (like the rich) and not a <em>have-not</em>?
  </span>
  <br>
  <span class="style4">&bull; How does Flaubert's choice to inflict the stable boy with a clubfoot reflect his feelings about the lower class? Is it a cooincidence that the poor stable boy is afflicted with an abnormality while the richer characters are free of physical defects? Explain.<br>
  &bull; Why do rich people struggle with such minor problems while poor people are able to overcome their disadvantages to live full lives? <br> 
  </span><br>
  <strong>feminist:</strong><br>
 <span class="style4">&bull; Do the women take on typical gender roles? Or are roles reversed? </span></font></span><span class="style21"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
 <span class="style4">&bull; Do you think Flaubert is taking a feminist position in regard to gender roles, such as Emma using &quot;technical terms at random, and impressive words like 'order,' 'the future,' and 'foresight'&hellip;&quot; (1191)</span><br>
 <span class="style4">&bull; The author stated that &quot;he was Madame Bovary&quot; (Flaubert<em>-Madame Bovary, c'est moi. </em>Louis IV<em>: L'&eacute;tat, c'est moi.</em>) So why did he make her a woman and why did he give her such manly tendencies?<br>
 &bull; Does the fact that Flaubert is male affect the person Emma is portrayed to be? <br>
 &bull; How does the portrayal of mothers shape the way the reader views women in this work? <br>
 &bull; How is feminism incorporated into <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Madame Bovary</em></font>? What qualities do female characters, especially Emma and the elder Madame Bovary) have that signifies feminism?<br>
 &bull; In <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Madame Bovary</em></font>, Emma is a woman who does not follow the traditional gender role that society expects. Flaubert portrays her in a very unsympathetic manner and her life turns out badly. What this characterization Flaubert's attempt to express his opinions on gender roles? Or is Flaubert commenting on societal intolerance to women who behave in this manner?<br>
 &bull; Why does Flaubert have Emma and Charles switch positions of power? Normally, the man holds all the power in the family, but then Emma takes power.<br>
 &bull; Is the way that Flaubert portrays Emma just a literary choice or the true views that society had about women at the time he wrote?<br>
  </span><strong><br>
  cultural/historical: </strong><br>
  <span class="style4">&bull; How does <em>Madame Bovary</em> reflect the period in which it was created?<br> 
  &bull; What are some of the characteristics of social interactions in the story?</span><br>
  <span class="style4">&bull; Does the socioeconomic status of Charles affect whether Emma is faithful to him?</span><br>
  <span class="style4">&bull; In what ways does Madame Bovary differ from the ordinary women of her time? How do her thoughts, dreams and actions differ from the norm of that time period and social class?<br>
&bull; Why is that Emma is suffering while playing the role of a housewife and second class citizen as a woman, but no other women are seen to be miserable? Are all the other women suffering in silence or is she abnormal for her time period?<br>
  </span></font></span><span class="style21"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="style4">&bull; How does the social idea of a &quot;reputation&quot; and the actions that are considered detrimental to a good reputation differ from our idea of reputation today? How is it similar? What does Emma actually do that is considered risky, aside from actually having an affair?<br>
  &bull; How does <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Madame Bovary</em></font> represent the Age of Realism? Could Flaubert have written the story during the Romantic period and still had the same effect?<br>
&bull; Why is the relationship between Emma and Charles such a huge conflict? Does the relationship of men and women during this time period keep Emma from telling Charles the truth about her feelings? [Note from Dr. B: this question got me thinking about the availability of divorce in France at this time: for more info see <a href="http://www.ohiou.edu/%7Echastain/dh/divorce.htm">http://www.ohiou.edu/~chastain/dh/divorce.htm</a> ]<br> 
&bull; How does Flaubert portary his contemporaries in Madame Bovary? Does he praise or condemn them? </span></font></span><span class="style21"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="style4"><br> 
  </span><br>
  <strong>psychological:</strong><br>
  <span class="style4">&bull;</span>  <span class="style4">What is Flaubert trying to say when he continually mentions Emma's desire to live like the characters in romance novels?<br>
  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&bull;</font> Is Emma's unconscious delusion between reality and expectation reflective of the effect Romantics had on Flaubert's own psyche and experience?<br>
&bull; How does Emma's behavior change throughout the story? What type of personality does she have? <br>
&bull; Which secondary characters made Emma think about her relationship with Charles?<br>
&bull; Why do you think the author includes the scene between Emma and Berthe where Berthe gets hurt? Since we already know the bad side of Emma's personality, what do you think this scene adds to the story? <br>
&bull; A lot can be learned about an individual's character by observing his/her thoughts and actions towards his/her significant other. How does Rodolphe's thoughts and actions towards Emma reflect his psychological state? What about Charles?<br>
&bull; Does Emma know what she really wants and is it in any way attainable? <br>
&bull; How are the dreams, desires and repressions of Emma and Charles presented? Consciously or unconsciously? And what do these dreams and desires reveal about Emma and Charles' personality and psychological state? <br>
&bull; Are some of Emma's problems due to mental illness and/or her environment?<br>
&bull; What were the psychological motivations of Charles in picking Emma as a wife and then allowing the marriage to drift apart without protest? <br>
&bull; How do Emma's thoughts and dreams reflect the attitude of the author?</span></font></span></p>
<p class="style2"><span class="style21"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>reader response: </strong><br>
  <span class="style4">&bull; How did you respond to Emma's love affaire wtih Leon? Did you see it as true love, and thus justified, or did you sympathize with Charles?<br>
  &bull; How do you respond emotionally to Emma? Do you see her as a likeable character at all? Do you see some of yourself in Emma? Does she remind you of a friend? What about makes her likeable/ unlikeable and why?<br>
  &bull; Given what you know about Rodolphe, what would you say to him if you were to meet him? Would you be civil? Tricky? Frank and disgusted? How long would you want to meet with him? What do you think would happen? What does that say about yourself? </span></font></span></p>

<p class="style2">Start thinking seriously about <a href="222Paper2-05.html">Paper 2</a>. Tonight I added a new topic to the list of choices: </p>
<p class="style2"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A. New idea, an experiment: <em>Critical creative rewriting</em></font></p>
<p class="style14"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You become the author. Take one of your favorite stories or plays and imagine what happens to the characters after the story ends (for example, &quot;Lady with a Dog,&quot; &quot;The Dead&quot;, &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;). You could also rewrite the story before it starts or focus on an important scene from a <em>different</em> character's point of view (Cun&eacute;gonde's, Berthe's or Gerasim's&hellip;) You could also write a letter from one character to another in the same story or a different story (What advice would Rodolphe give Ashenbach?). <br>
  <br>
</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pay attention to the author's narrative style, plot, characterization, vocabulary and imagery, so that you can imitate it (or even make a parody of it). This creative part of Paper 2 should be two to three pages long. The other half of the paper will be the critical portion: a writing journal or commentary. Explain the stages of your project: the choice of story or character, the problems and reflections you had while rewriting, what you learned about your author and text and the process of writing.</font></p>
<p class="style14"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In other words, your <em>rewrite</em> is your <strong>response</strong> to a text. Your <em>commentary</em> is the <strong>reflection</strong> on that response. For the peer review draft, you should include a page of your rewriting and a page of commentary, perhaps an outline.</font></p>

I will be taking role and collecting homework. You'll be discussing the following 3 questions and writing up a group report. <br>
<br>
Writing Assignment:<br>
Question 1: Who is Judith Shakespeare? Why does Woolf create her? What is Woolf's message?</p>
<p class="style2">Question 2: Choose any work we've read so far and speculate about how it might have been different if the work had been written by a woman rather than a man. (There is no right or wrong answer: let your imagination take you somewhere. Would the characters be different? The plot? The ending? How does the author's gender impact his or her art?)</p>
<p class="style2">Question 3:<span class="style4"> List 3 elements of modernism that you can find in our example of Virginia Woolf's fiction<em>,</em> the very short story<em>,  An Unwritten Novel</em></span><span class="style21"><em>.<br>
  <br>

<p class="style2"> The narrator, while riding in a train, imagines possible characters and plots for a novel, based on her observations of another passenger whom she calls &quot;Minnie Marsh.&quot; The narrative alternates between imaginative creation and objective observation, leading the narrator to unexpected discoveries about herself and the nature of art and artistic representation.</p>

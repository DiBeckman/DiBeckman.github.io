Art exists so we may recover the sensation of life as it is seen, perceived, not 
as it is known. The artist must increase the difficulty and length of the experience 
of perception. The role of art is to defamiliarize: to make things seem unfamiliar 
rather than automatic; to make us see things as if we were seeing them for the 
first time. <br>

</b></font><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
Artists and industrialization <br>
&#149; what subject matter should be<br>
&#149; who the audience should be<br>
&#149; what materials, techniques to use<br>
<br>
Counterpoint to romanticism <br>
<br>
Focus on &#147;truth&#148; rather than the &#147;fantastic, historical, remote, 
idealized, unsullied, idyllic&#148; (839) &#147;what is&#148; (the real) vs. &#147;what 
should be&#148; (the ideal) <br>
<br>
<b>Honesty</b>. Realism: Philippe Duranty: &#147;the exact, complete and sincere 
reproduction of the social milieu in which we live&#148;; Henri Bayle: &#147;A 
novel is a mirror walking along the road.&#148; <br>
<br>
The novel rather than poetry. Why? <br>
1) Varied aspects of society <br>
2) New readership; easily accessible newspapers and journals<br>
<b><br>
Novelist as sociologist</b>. Observation and objectivity. Portray and criticize 
society. <br>
<br>
<b>Subject matter</b>: commonplace, even the low, the disgusting. Serious purpose, 
often tragic. <br>
<br>
<b>Objectivity in narration</b>: Author shows rather than tells; should be like 
God in his universe &#147;present everywhere but visible nowhere.&#148; (Flaubert)</font> <br>

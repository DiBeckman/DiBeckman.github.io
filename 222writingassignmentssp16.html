  <p>*This and all subsequent references to Shannon are from Edward Shannon's <span class="text">The Prentice Hall Guide to Writing about Literature</span> (Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2002) which went out of print in 2010. I  replaced it with <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> as a textbook for our class. Details about what he means by &quot;confusing, repeated, familiar and strange&quot; can be found <a href="222Shannonmore.html">here</a>.</p>
  <p>Write a one-paragraph to one-page summary of Chapter 1 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>. Include the title of each chapter in your heading, since   it should reflect the main point of the chapter. Your summary should include the main points and any others that seem especially helpful or surprising to you. Some students prefer to an outline format or question format. (See <a href="222ShortGuideSample.pdf">this example</a> of a question format and <a href="222ASGoutline.pdf">this example</a> of an outline format.) Outlining, writing questions, and summarizing are all useful skills. You may handwrite or type it, and you may include it on the same page with your discussion of the first stanza of <span class="text">Essay on Man. </span>You may submit<span class="text"> A Short Guide</span> assignments electronically since I will not make extensive comments on them. If they are submitted electronically, they will be returned to you electronically. </p>
  <p> Print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222Enlightenment.html">The Enlightenment</a> and <a href="222GreatChain.html">The Great Chain of Being</a> if you want to use them to take notes.</p>
<p>In addition, for this and the next assignment, take a look at  my web page on <a href="Explication.html"><em>Explication de Texte</em></a><em>.</em> It will be useful for your <a href="222poetrypresentation.html">Poetry Presentation</a> due on <span class="date">January 29 </span>and<span class="date"> February 1</span>.</p>

    <li>Read <span class="text">Essay on Man</span> and write a page about your stanza to turn in. In case you're not sure what a <em>stanza</em> is, you can look this and other literary terms up in our course <a href="222Glossary.html">Glossary</a>, the Glossary in Appendix B of <span class="text">A Short Guide to Writing About Literature</span>, or the <a href="http://wwnorton.com/college/english/nawest9/literaryterms.aspx">Glossary</a> on the Norton web site.<br />
      <br />
Note that the Roman numerals I-X at the beginning of each stanza correspond to your assigned stanza number (not a page or line number). What is the stanza about? Give a one-sentence summary. Answer  Shannon's 4 questions. Also, what are the key words and images in the stanza? How does the stanza connect with the ideas of the Enlightenment we've discussed? What is  the attitude of the narrator? What is the role of nature, especially animals, if any appear in your stanza?</li>
    <li>Write a one-paragraph to one-page summary or outline of Chapter 2 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> to turn in. Take, correct, and turn in your answers to the Quiz in Appendix B  364-371 of <span class="text">A Short Guide.</span></li>

      <ol class="spaced">
        <li>See Lecture Notes on <a href="222ShortStoryNovel.html">Different Forms of Prose Fiction</a>; <a href="222SatireIronyUtopia.html">Satire, Irony and Utopia</a>. Read <a href="222Panglossian.htm">Panglossian</a>. </li>

        <li> Read Chapter 10 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> and write a summary to turn in. </li>
        <li>Consider bookmarking an online dictionary, such as <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/">dictionary.com</a> or <a href="http://www.m-w.com/">Merriam-Webster</a> to make it easy to look up words you don't know. If you are doing the Reading Notebook, you can print out the definitions to include in your notebook. Do you like words or want to improve your vocabulary (GRE in your future?)? I recommend that you sign up for the free daily email from  Anu Gang <a href="http://wordsmith.org/awad/subscribe.html">A Word a Day</a>.</li>

<h2 class="class">Class 5 (Voltaire, Lecture 2) <span class="date">due Friday, January 15</span></h2>
<ul><li> Discuss the following questions after you do the reading assignment (Chapters 14-22). Quote from the text with examples to support your answers and include the page reference for each quotation.
          <ul>
            <li>Is Eldorado a genuine utopia or (in one critic's words) &quot;a colossal bore&hellip;satirized by Voltaire as foolish and futile&quot;?</li>
            <li>Which specific behaviors or institutions show us that Voltaire wants the reader to see Eldorado as utopic?</li>
            <li>Does Voltaire have a philosophical lesson in mind or is it pure satire? Or both?</li>
            <li>How does it correspond to your personal view of Utopia?</li></ul>
        </li>
</ul>
<ul><li>See Lecture Notes on <a href="222dulce.html">Dulce et utile</a>.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Read Chapter 3 in <em>A Short Guide</em> and write a summary to turn in.</li></ul>
 <ul><li>The first original contribution post&mdash;on Pope&mdash;is due <span class="date">tonight</span> at midnight. You will have many authors to choose from to do your required 14 posts (7 original contributions and 7 responses), but I encourage you to get in the habit of posting by starting with Pope or Voltaire. For an original contribution post, make a point or develop an argument of at least <span class="red">one  full paragraph (5-8 sentences)</span> based on something you read, learned or thought while reading <em>An Essay on Man</em>. Ask a question or make a provocative statement for your classmates to respond to. You may also include a quote from the text under discussion or links to other web sites. Did something in your homework get praise or a lot of comment from me? If so, it might be the basis of a good post. </li></ul>

     <h2><span class="class">Class 6 (Voltaire, Lecture 3)</span> <span class="date">due Wednesday, January 20</span></h2>
    <p>Read the page in Supplementary Materials, <a href="Candide%20quotes.html">Quotes from different critics about &quot;Il faut cultiver notre jardin.&quot;</a> Write a page which includes answers to the following questions: what are some  literal and figurative meanings of the word <em>garden</em>? How do they apply to Candide's garden? How do <strong>you</strong> interpret the final line of the story? </p>
    <p>To help you to understand the difference between <strong>literal</strong> and <strong>figurative</strong>, here is  an example I found online:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>literal</strong> vs. <strong>figurative</strong> meaning - relates to the meanings of words and phrases or expressions. For example, &quot;She was all ears&quot; has a <strong>figurative</strong> meaning (She was listening intently) as well as a <strong>literal</strong> meaning (Her body was composed of ears or she had a huge set of ears). <span class="citation"><a href="http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm">Literary Terms for English</a></span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Read <em>A Short Guide</em> Chapter 4, and write a summary to turn in.</p>
    <p>Recommended reading before <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~dsbeckma/222Romanticismillustrated.html">Romanticism</a>: <em>Preface </em>xxi-xxvi; the rest of <em>What is Enlightenment?</em> 16-52 in the Norton Anthology.</p>
    <p><strong><span class="extracredit">Extra Credit Opportunities</span></strong>: In honor of the Martin Luther King Holiday, watch and/or read MLK's celebrated <span class="text"><a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkihaveadream.htm">I Have a Dream</a></span> speech  and write a page about it from a literary perspective. How did it entertain and instruct? What figures of speech or rhetoric were used? Any literary allusions? What was repeated and familiar? (Ideally, not too much will be strange or confusing.) If you prefer, you could also choose the lyrics from your favorite song, and write a short literary analysis, with special focus on the figures of speech used there.</p>

</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Choose any one of the following questions to answer and<strong> include the question </strong>with your answer. These questions would also inspire some good discussions in your Moodle posts.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <div class="maroon">
    <h3>FORMALIST CRITICISM:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>How are the extremes of each character in <em>Madame Bovary</em> integral to revealing the character of Emma? </li>
      <li>From what point of view does Flaubert compose <em>Madame Bovary</em>? How does this point of view contribute to the plot/themes, and how does this point of view aid in the reader's comprehension of key ideas?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h3>SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
  <div class="red">
    <h4>Marxist Criticism:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> &quot;What sort of 'change of fate' do characters in Madame Bovary experience when they interact with characters in other social classes, if any?</li>
      <li>How do the characters reflect the divisions of social class of this time, and the challenges surrounding social mobility?</li>
      <li>What do you think Flaubert was trying to highlight about social class through his writing of <em>Madame Bovary</em>?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="purple">
    <h4>Feminist Criticism: </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>How do Emma's ideas about love and marriage hinder her relationships with the men in her life?</li>
      <li>What message is Emma's personality presenting about the role of women and their desires, particularly compared to their male counterparts?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="teal">
    <h3>CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>How does Flaubert portray the social mores of the Bourgeoisie (French Middle Class) of the late nineteenth-century through his characters, and is his portrayal historically correct?</li>
      <li>What are the historical implications of Flaubert's choice to make Charles a doctor (health officer) in this time period? What was the public opinion of people in the medical field?</li>
      <li>How does Flaubert's Realist writing differ from the Romantic works of Wordsworth and Pushkin?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="orange">
    <p><strong>PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Emma is plagued by delusions of grandeur and maintains unrealistic expectations throughout the novel. Oftentimes these kinds of issues are formed early in childhood due to a child's environment, or they can be caused by chemical/hormonal imbalances within the body. What is the cause of Emma's need for attention and unrealistic expectations and could her psychological troubles be passed on to Berthe?</li>
      <li>Do you think that Emma's romantic life and maybe life in general is based on only wanting what she can't have?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="blue">
    <h3>READER RESPONSE CRITICISM:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What was your impression on Emma from Part 1 and how has it changed after reading parts 2 (and 3)?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="green">
    <h3>ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What is the impact of the original location of the characters and how does that impact relate to their character? (i.e. Madame Bovary III is originally from a rural farm).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="fuchsia">
    <h3>QUEER THEORY: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In what ways does Emma's short and unsuccessful contrition for religious healing foreshadow her ensuing sexuality with Leon? (Think about what/who led her to the church in Part II, Ch. 6) Is it ironic or superficial that after a church tour, Emma and Leon make love? </li>
      <li>How does Emma deal with her own sexual deviance and breaking of social norms?</li>
    </ul>

Dr. B adds: I especially like this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atHQpANmHCE&amp;list=PLwg4AG1KkgLwP5FuUIiVEy-ILMD23AN1v&amp;index=4">one</a> on <em>The Treachery of Images</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;References to Greek culture permeate this story because they represent Aschenbach&rsquo;s traditional German admiration for Greek art and philosophy and partly because the web of allusions supports the development of other themes in the novella.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="maroon">
  <h3>FORMALIST CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How does the bug&rsquo;s eye view contribute to our understanding of the inner natures possessed by Gregor&rsquo;s father and his sister Grete?</li>
    <li>Gregor’s mother, father, and sister cope with his metamorphosis in different ways. What details about their relationships and personalities are revealed through the form of the story?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h3>SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
<div class="red">
  <h4>Marxist Criticism:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>How does <em>The Metamorphisis</em> break the expectation of a Marxist society in the first half of the book?</li>
    <li>What social class is Gregor and his family? How do you know? How does this factor into the story?<br />
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="purple">
  <h4>Feminist Criticism: </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>How do the two women in the story, Grete and Gregor's mother, play differing roles as far as Gregor's care goes and how do they reflect or contrast the typical roles and behavior of women during the time?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="teal">
  <h3>CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>      How does Kafka portray the social norms in the time period <em>The Metamorphosis</em> represents?</li>
    <li>Franz Kafka never directly identifies the anti-Semitic conditions in Europe in <em>The Metamorphosis</em>, yet it has been suggested that this is one of the social problems addressed in The Metamorphosis. &nbsp;Therefore, how might Kafka be illustrating the social conflicts facing Jews in central Europe at the end of World War I?<br />
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="orange">
  <h3>PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Throughout the first half of the story we can observe that Gregor is a man who is capable of excepting his circumstances, regardless of how miraculous or befuddling as they appear to be. What could cause Gregor to not question the fact that he has turned into an insect? Or, has he even been changed at all and he simply perceives himself as an insect?</li>
    <li>What do you think Kafka is trying to say with the interactions of the characters to the metamorphosis?</li>
    <li>Is there a specific mental disorder that Gregor is suffering from after his transformation?  </li>
    <li>How do Gregor's way of thinking and identity change throughout the first half of <em>The Metamorphosis</em>?</li>
    <li>In what way does Kafka present a sort of internal struggle in his work &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="blue">
  <h3>READER RESPONSE CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>What effect does communication have on Gregor as a human and a bug in understanding his identity and daily routines? </p>
    </li>
    <li>How do your own experiences affect your interpretation of <em>The Metamorphosis</em>? if it were me who turned into a big insect-like creature, I would hide myself and not let anyone find me.</li>
    <li>How do you feel when Gregor's family is treating him completely different due to his appearance?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="green">
  <h3>ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Why is Gregor's family so repulsed by his new (natural) form?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="fuchsia">
  <h3>QUEER THEORY: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How does the way Gregor's family treats him after he becomes a vermin similar to the behavior of homophobic family or friends?</li>
  </ul>

<h2><span class="class">Class 34 (Thesis exercise and Peer review of Term Paper proposal) </span><span class="date">due Wednesday, April 6</span></h2>
<p>The first part of class will be devoted to <em>The Thesis Exercise</em>. Read the <a href="222Thesis exercise.html">web page</a> about how to write a thesis for a literary paper. Print and fill out the <a href="222Theses.html">page of sample FL 222 theses</a> where you rate the examples. The second half of class will be devoted to peer review of the first pre-draft of your <a href="222Paper2010.html">Paper</a>. </p>
<p>Print out <strong>two copies</strong> of the <a href="Peerevaluation2.pdf">Peer Review Feedback Form</a> to include with the <strong>two copies</strong> of your draft which you will bring for your classmates. Fill out the top part of the form with your name, paper title, and date. Do <strong>not wait</strong> until the last minute to print these materials out. Email me before class if you have an idea for your own original topic so that I can approve it. Speaking of original, a very creative paper where almost all the main characters meet in Hell written by a former student is featured <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~dsbeckma/To Hell with Literature.htm"> here</a>, and my favorite missing chapter of <em>Candide</em> is <a href="222VoltaireCandide.html">here</a>. The complete first draft will be due to me on <span class="date">Monday, April 11.</span></p>
<p>Selected writing advice from the <a href="222Paper2010.html">Term Paper page:</a></p>
<p>Read through the topic choices below. Consult Chapter 10 in <span class="text"> A Short Guide, Writing about Fiction: the World of the Story</span>, especially the pages on &quot;Getting Ideas&quot; (171-5).  Which texts have been your favorite or challenged you the most? Send me an email or make an appointment if you need help deciding on a topic. <span class="red">If you are doing a creative project, you will not have a <strong>thesis </strong>per se in your rough draft, but you will replace that with a <strong>story premise </strong>that explains what the goal of your project is and how it relates to the text(s) you are responding to. </span></p>
<h3>Paper Topics</h3>
<p><strong>A. Critical creative rewriting</strong></p>
<p>You become the author/artist. Take one of your favorite stories, poems or plays and imagine what happens to the characters after the story ends. You could also rewrite the story before it starts or focus on an important scene from a <em>different</em> character's point of view: Cun&eacute;gonde's, Berthe's or Gerasim's&hellip; One student rewrote Pope's <span class="text">Essay on Man</span> in the format of Baudelaire's &quot;Enivirez-vous.&quot; You could also write a letter from one character to another in the same story or a different story. For example: What advice would Rodolphe give Ashenbach? For a model, see <a href="http://grammar.about.com/od/classicessays/a/franklinmis.htm">Ben Franklin's letter of &quot;Advice on Choosing a Mistress</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the author's narrative style, plot, characterization, vocabulary and imagery, so that you can imitate it (or even make a parody of it). If you use direct quotes from the original text, put these passages <em>in italics. </em>Include the page reference for your quote. Do not include historical anachronisms, such as a telephone in <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> or snooze button on Gregor's alarm clock.</p>
<p> The <strong>creative</strong> part of the paper should be two to three pages long. </p>
<p>The second half of the paper will be the <strong>critical </strong>portion: a writing journal or commentary. It should also be a minimum of three pages long for the final version. Explain the stages of your project: first, the choice of story or character, next, the problems and reflections you had while rewriting, including all the ideas you came up with and rejected and the reasons why. Some of the other ideas may lead to other projects later and it is good to have a record of them. Finally, include what you learned about your author and text and the process of writing. For example, what did you notice about your author's style when you read the story for class? What did you notice for the first time during or after class? How did your observation or appreciation of his/her style change as you worked on imitating it? For specifics, be sure to mention the criteria listed <a href="222ImitateStyle.html">here</a>.  The writing journal portion of this paper  is one of the rare occasions in a college paper where it is appropriate to use &quot;I,&quot; as you recount your experience as a writer. </p>
<p>In other words, your <em>rewrite</em> is your <strong>response</strong> to a text. Your <em>commentary</em> is the <strong>reflection</strong> on that response. For the peer review draft, you should include a page of your rewriting and a page of commentary, perhaps an outline. You will not have a thesis, per se, but you should have a <strong>very clear story idea or premise for alternative art project</strong>. Date entries in your writer's journal. Each time you get new input, such as your peer reviews and your instructor review,  revise your creative section, and add to the journal section to reflect the new issues raised by the reviewers. </p>
<p>You can  read the stories written by students in previous semesters <a href="222CreativeWriting.htm">here</a>. An amazing example which includes the majority of characters studied in FL 222 is <em><a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~dsbeckma/To Hell with Literature.htm">To Hell With Literature</a></em>(Joey Schopper, Fall 2006).</p>
<p>Need a name for a character in your creative story? To get the nationality right, check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_given_names">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_given_names</a></p>
<p><strong>B. Compare and contrast</strong> at least 2 texts from 2 different authors, including one 
  from the second half of the semester. <span class="red">Use the following comments as a <strong>guide</strong> to develop <strong>your own thesis</strong>. You do not need to answer all of them; you <strong>do</strong> need to have a coherent thesis.  Reminder: an thesis is not a topic, fact or opinion. It is an argument.</span> You may also choose your own topic. (See D below.)</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>The Function of Setting in</strong>&#133; (Tolstoy, Woolf, Kafka, Joyce, Brecht, 
    Camus&#133;)
    Discuss how the setting in these texts contributes to the main theme. Include 
    such issues as the history, particular location, spatial relations and the meaning 
    of movement from one space to another, the social meaning of space and place, 
    etc.</li>
  <li><strong> Illness, Disease and Death in</strong>&#133; (Flaubert, Tolstoy, Joyce, Mann, 
    Kafka&#133;) Describe how the authors represent illness, disease, and death, 
    and how these themes function in the texts. Pay attention to the societal aspects 
    of disease and death. Recommended reading&mdash;two articles  related to what I call <a href="222Isolationandcontact.html">The Gerasim Effect</a>&mdash;<em>The United States holds tens of thousands of inmates in long-term solitary confinement. Is this torture?</em> by Atul Gawande  and <em>Comforter and Comforted in an Unfolding Mystery</em> by Nell Burger Kirst. </li>
  <li><strong> The representation of gender roles in</strong>&#133;What positions do men and women occupy in society? What is expected of them because of their gender? What limitations does their gender impose? How does it shape romantic love? What are the differences between married love and romantic love that are portrayed? You may end with a comparison to contemporary gender roles.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>C. Text and Film/ Theater</strong>. See a filmed version of one of the texts we have read 
  in class or attend one of the plays performed locally this semester. Films can be viewed online or at DH Hill (see <a href="https://reserves.lib.ncsu.edu/"> reserve</a> holdings for our class). Write an analysis comparing the two&#151;consider how reading 
  and watching film are different. For example, <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span>, &quot;The Dead,&quot; &quot;The Lady with a Dog,&quot; &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest,&quot; and <span class="text">Death in Venice</span> have all been made into films. Your thesis should focus your evaluation of how the filmed version relates to the text version. Is it a successful, weak or failed adaptation? Is it a respectful hommage? A brilliant or flawed reworking of the original? </p>
<p> Here are some questions to think about: </p>
<ul>
  <li>What scenes were left out and what scenes were added? How did these changes 
    improve or detract from the story? You might want to concentrate on one element 
    or even one scene, such as the ending.</li>
  <li>How would you rate the director and the 
    choice of cast? Did the actors who played the roles in the film conform to your 
    expectations?</li>
  <li>How does the use of language, or the way certain actors behave, 
    imply a whole range of characteristics described in words in the book?</li>
  <li>Did the 
    director set the right tone for the film?</li>
  <li>How is seeing a play performed different than reading it?</li>
</ul>
<p>See &quot;Getting Ideas for Writing about a Film Based on a Work of Literature&quot; (176-78) or &quot;Getting Ideas for Writing about a Film Based on a Play&quot; (216-20) in <span class="text"> A Short Guide</span>.</p>
<p>If you are using a novel that has been remade into film several times, you might 
  want to consider the same scene in more than one version and think about time-related 
  choices. For instance, <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> has been remade in almost every decade 
  of the 20th century, incuding versions by Jean Renoir in 1933, Vincent Minnelli in 1949, and Claude Chabrol in 1991.  The emphasis in the films is different in part because 
  each reflects its own time and the ideas of its director.</p>
<p>See <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> (339) to cite a film or DVD. A useful site to find important quotes from movies: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Search/quotes">http://www.imdb.com/Search/quotes</a>. It is also often useful to listen to the director's commentary, if you are using a DVD with this feature.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> You may also propose <strong>your own topic</strong> as long as it is a <strong>comparison</strong>.  Your proposed topic must be submitted 
  to me for approval by the date of the peer review (<span class="date">today</span>).</p>
<p>Sample topics from previous semesters: Blake's &quot;London&quot; and Wordsworth's &quot;Composed on Westminster Bridge&quot;; Autumn poems by Keats, Baudelaire, Verlaine and Auden; Death-bed scenes in Dickinson's 465 &quot;I heard a Fly buzz&quot; or 712 &quot;Because I could not stop for Death,&quot; and Emma's death scene in <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> or Ivan's in <span class="text">The Death of Ivan Ilyich</span>; <span class="text">Candide</span> and <span class="text">Forrest Gump</span>; Utopias in <span class="text">Candide</span> and <span class="text">The Village</span>; <span class="text">Wedding Crashers</span> and <span class="text">The Importance of Being Earnest</span>; <span class="text">Slumdog Millionaire</span> and <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> or <span class="text">Candide</span>; &quot;A Room of One's Own&quot; and Michael Cunningham's <span class="text"> The Hours;</span> <em>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</em> and Abrom's <span class="text">Tuesdays with Morrie</span>; <a href="222ASG14.html">Paintings and Poems</a>&hellip; The list goes on&hellip;</p>
<p>Posts due at midnight: original commentary on Proust</p>
<h2><span class="class">Class 35 (Eliot and the Surrealists)</span><span class="date"> due Friday, April 8</span></h2>
<p>Choose a poem from today's <a href="222EliotSurrealists.pdf">reading assignment</a> to write about: &quot;The Hollow Men,&quot; &quot;Dadaist Disgust,&quot; &quot;Proclamation without Pretension,&quot; or &quot;Free Union.&quot; Answer Shannon's 4 questions. Note important images, poetic devices, and modernist elements. What does the poem defamiliarize or do that is unexpected? Write a sentence or two about what you think the poem means. You do not need to bring your Norton Anthology, since the poems are not in there, but in the <a href="222EliotSurrealists.pdf">pdf</a> linked here and on the syllabus. It would be good to have copies of the poems with you, either as hard copies or on your computer/device. Be sure to bring a <strong>blank piece of notebook paper</strong> to class today as well.</p>

<h2><span class="class">Class 38 (Woolf 2)</span> <span class="date">due Friday, April 15</span></h2>
<p><span class="red">Alert: Class will be meeting at the new Stanhope IHOP (International House of Pancakes) on Hillsborough Street today, provided it opens on April 10 as announced. !</span> I will be taking roll and collecting homework.  You'll also be discussing your answers to the following  questions, and some that I pass out at IHOP from chapter 3, and submitting a group report.<br />
  <br />
  Writing Assignment:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Who is Judith Shakespeare? Why does Woolf create her? What is the message about women and women writers that Woolf suggests by telling Judith's story? Is Judith fact, fiction, truth, a lie?</li>
  <li> Choose any work we've read so far and speculate about how it might have been different if the work had been written by a woman rather than a man. (There is no right or wrong answer: let your imagination take you somewhere. Would the characters be different? The plot? The ending? How does the author's gender impact his or her art?) </li>
  <li>Watch this eleven-minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4UWxlVvT1A">video</a> by French director Eleonore Pourriat. What is your reaction? What issues does it share with <em>A Room of One's Own</em>? How do you think Virginia Woolf might react to it if she could see it? </li>
</ol>

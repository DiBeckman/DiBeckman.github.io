<p class="style3">IMDB Summary: Teacher Fran&ccedil;ois Marin and his colleagues are preparing for another school year teaching at a racially mixed inner city high school in Paris. The teachers talk to each other about their prospective students, both the good and the bad. The teachers collectively want to inspire their students, but each teacher is an individual who will do things in his or her own way to achieve the results they desire. They also have differing viewpoints on the students themselves, and how best to praise and discipline them. The administration of the school tries to be as fair as possible, which includes having student representatives sit on the student evaluation committee. Marin's class this year of fourteen and fifteen year olds is no different than previous years, although the names and faces have changed. Marin tries to get through to his students, sometimes with success and sometimes resulting in utter failure. Even Marin has his breaking point, which may result in him doing things he would probably admit to himself are wrong. But after all is said and done, there is next year and another group of students. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068646/plotsummary">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068646/plotsummary<br />

<p class="style3"><strong>Le Fabuleux Destin d&rsquo;Am&eacute;lie Poulin</strong> <strong>(Am&eacute;lie)</strong>: directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Originally released as a motion picture in 2001. Am&eacute;lie, misdiagnosed with an unusual heart condition, didn't attend school with other children, but spent most of her time in her room, where she developed a keen imagination and an active fantasy life. Despite all this, Am&eacute;lie has grown into a healthy and beautiful young woman who works in a cafe and has a whimsical, romantic nature. She decides to step into the lives of others around her to help them out.</p>

<p class="style3">IMDB plot summary:<em> Le Fabuleux Destin d'Am&eacute;lie Poulain</em> is a film about an extremely imaginative young girl, Amelie (Audrey Tautou), who had a very isolated upbringing. The film begins by explaining what happened to her as a child and then moves on to see her moving into her own flat and with her first job as a waitress. The story line is fairly mundane but is jazzed up by Amelie's ways of dealing with things, she meets a man, Nino Quincampoix (Mathieu Kassovitz), and basically plays a game with him. He lost one of his photo albums which she later finds. Instead of simply returning the photo album she does it in a truely unique and exciting manner. The film is presented in a magical way where the viewer is bombarded with trivial yet sweet information on the arrival of any new character, the interesting subplots throughout the film and the strange thoughts and crazy antics of Amelie herself. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0211915/synopsis">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0211915/synopsis</a></p>

<p class="style3">IMDB Summary: Fran&ccedil;ois is a middle-aged antique dealer. He has a stylish apartment and a fabulous life, but at a dinner with a group he considers his dearest acquaintances, he is blindsided by the revelation that none of them actually likes him. He's arrogant, self-centered and harsh, and they don't believe he knows the meaning of friendship. His business partner Catherine makes him a bet: if he can produce his best friend, she will let him keep the massive Greek vase he acquired that afternoon on the company tab. If not, it's hers. Having accepted the wager, Fran&ccedil;ois naively tears through his address book, trying to shoehorn an increasingly unlikely series of contacts into the all-important role. Moving through Paris, he keeps encountering a trivia-spouting, big-hearted cabbie named Bruno. Bruno's chatty, lowbrow ways grate against Fran&ccedil;ois's designer temperament, but he covets the other man's easy way with people. He convinces Bruno to teach him how to make friends and sets about learning the &quot;three S's&quot; - being sociable, smiling and sincere - though they don't come easy. Ultimately, Fran&ccedil;ois' victory will depend on Bruno's naivet&eacute; in playing along, but what's the cost of cheating at friendship? <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0778784/plotsummary">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0778784/plotsummary</a></p>

  <strong>Le Placard (The Closet)</strong>: written and directed by Francis Veber. Originally released as a motion picture in 2001. Fran&ccedil;ois Pignon, a very bland sort of man who works as an accountant in a condom factory, is about to be fired. His new neighbour comes up with an idea to prevent such a thing from happening: he creates photos and then spreads the rumor that Fran&ccedil;ois is gay so that the factory management might be afraid they'll be sued for sexual discrimination. Of course, nothing happens as it should, but the changes in Fran&ccedil;ois Pignon's life-- and other people's too - are drastic!</p>
<p class="style3">IMDB plot summary: Fran&ccedil;ois Pignon (Daniel Auteuil) is a non-entity accountant, divorced two years but still in love with his wife and wanting a better relationship with their 17 year old son. Then, he is the last in his company to hear that he is to be fired. A neighbour suggests that Pignon creates the impression that he is gay, so that the company executives will find it difficult to fire him or else be thought homophobic. The plan works. Meanwhile, F&eacute;lix Santini (G&eacute;rard Depardieu) is convinced, by joking fellow-executives, that Santini must treat Pignon particularly well or run the risk of charges of homophobia. Santini's bumbling attempts at positive contact with Pignon make the middle of the movie somewhat silly, but Depardieu's straight-faced believability saves this part of the movie.<br />

<p class="style3">IMDB Summary: Luis Costa (Alain Chabat) is living a charmed life: he is a successful perfume designer, known around the office as &quot;Le Nez&quot; (the nose), he is a handsome forty-something, and above all, he's carefree and single. He dates whomever he pleases and happily lives alone.  Luis' happy existence is threatened when his strongwilled mother and five equally overbearing sisters decide it's time for him to marry. They are sick of doing his laundry, cooking his meals and waiting on him hand and foot, so they set him up on a seemingly neverending series of blind dates with all of the single women they know (and even some that they don't -- found via the internet).  After a month of exhausting bad dates, and too afraid to take on his family, Luis hatches a hare-brained scheme: he will find the &quot;perfect woman,&quot; pay her to pose as his fiancee and charm his family, but then jilt him at the altar on their wedding day. That way, his family will feel sorry for him and never mention marriage to him ever again. Emmanuelle (Charlotte Gainsbourg), his best friend's sister, has just moved to Paris and is looking for a quick way to earn some cash. It seems like a win-win situation, but the best-laid plans of single men can go horribly and hilariously wrong. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478724/synopsis">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478724/synopsis</a></p>

<p class="style1"><strong>Le Scaphandre et le papillon (The Diving Bell and the Butterfly)</strong>: written by Ronald Harwood, based on the book by Jean-Dominique Bauby, and directed by Julien Schnaubel. Originally released as a motion picture in 2007. The French editor of <em>Elle</em> magazine, Jean-Dominique Bauby, who, in 1995 at the age of 43, suffered a stroke that paralyzed his entire body, except his left eye. Using that eye to blink out his memoir, Bauby eloquently described the aspects of his interior world, from the psychological torment of being trapped inside his body to his imagined stories from lands he'd only visited in his mind.<br />

<p class="style14"><span class="style7">Class 2: (Pope, Lecture 1)</span> <span class="style13">due Friday, January 9 </span><br />
  Read the argument (summary) and first stanza of Pope's <em>Essay on Man</em>. Write a page about the first stanza (lines 1-16) answering Shannon's 4 questions. <br />
  What is confusing?<br />

  What is strange?<br />
  <br />
  Print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222Enlightenment.html">The Enlightenment</a> and <a href="222GreatChain.html">The Great Chain of Being</a> </p>
<p class="style14">In addition, for this and the next assignment, take a look at  my web page on <a href="Explication.html"><em>Explication de Texte</em></a> and these web sites about figures of speech which are also listed on the handy <a href="222supmatf04.html">Supplementary Materials</a> page.<font color="#990000"><font color="#000000"> These pages will  be useful for your <a href="222poetrypresentation.html">Poetry Presentation</a> due</font></font><span class="style13"> January 30 and February 2</span><font color="#990000"><font color="#000000">. </font></font><font color="#990000"><span class="style43"><font color="#000000"><br />

  <font color="#000000">1) <a href="http://www.nipissingu.ca/faculty/williams/figofspe.htm">http://www.nipissingu.ca/faculty/williams/figofspe.htm</a><br />
    This site contains figures of speech, thought, repetition, more than you can shake a stick at! Most examples are drawn from Shakespeare.<br />

</a>This site is very cool because it has sound clips and draws from a wide range of speeches, movies, and more to illustrate the Figures of Speech. For example, see and listen to quotes from Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln, and Neil Armstrong on the page about antitheses: <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/figures/antithesis.htm">http://www.americanrhetoric.com/figures/antithesis.htm</a></p>

    <br />
  2) Read <em>Essay on Man</em> and write a page about your stanza to turn in. (Note that the Roman numerals I-X at the beginning of each stanza correspond to your assigned stanza number.) What is the stanza about? Give a one sentence summary. Answer the 4 questions from Shannon. Also, what are the key words and images in the stanza? How does the stanza connect with the ideas of the Enlightenment we've discussed? What is  the attitude of the narrator? What is the role of nature, especially animals, if any appear in your stanza?</p>
<p class="style1">3)<span class="style7"> <span class="style44">After reading Shannon Chapter 1, write your own definition of literature to turn in. Make it as short and complete as possible.</span></span> You can put it on the same sheet of paper as your discussion of your stanza. </p>
<p class="style1">4) Your first WebCT post is due at midnight on Monday. <br />
  Instructions: Login to <a href="http://vista.ncsu.edu/index.php">WebCT Vista</a>. <br />
  Do the Browser check and enable pop-up windows.<br />
  Enter your Unity ID and Password. <br />

  Click on Introduction.<br />
  You will see the first topic, Introductory Post, by me. Read the assignment (Please introduce yourself to the rest of the class and tell us: if you could invite any three people, alive, dead or fictional, to dinner at your place, whom would you invite, why, and what would you serve?). Respond. </p>
<p class="style1">5) See the <a href="Type/ExtraCreditType.html">Extra Credit Assignment on <em>Myers-Briggs Type in College</em></a> I'm INFJ. If you have comments or questions about Myers-Briggs Type, feel free to share them as part of the introduction. You can do this assignment any time in the first month of classes. </p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style7">Class 4 (Voltaire, Lecture 1)</span> <span class="style13">due Wednesday, January 14 </span><br />
    <br />
  1) Write a page about the first thirteen chapters of <em>Candide</em> answering Shannon's 4 questions. </p>
<p class="style14">2) Print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222ShortStoryNovel.html">Different Forms of Prose Fiction</a>; <a href="222SatireIronyUtopia.html">Satire, Irony and Utopia</a>. Read <a href="222Panglossian.htm">Panglossian</a>. 3) Consider bookmarking an online dictionary or two to make it easy to look up words you don't know. If you are doing the Reading Notebook, you can print out the definitions to include in your notebook. <br />

<p class="style14"><span class="style45">Class 5 (Voltaire, Lecture 2) <span class="style13">due Friday, January 16 </span><br />
      <span class="style4">Discuss the following question after you do the reading assignment (Chapters 14-22). Is Eldorado a genuine utopia or (in one critic's words) &quot;a colossal bore&hellip;satirized by Voltaire as foolish and futile&quot;? Which specific behaviors or institutions show us that Voltaire wants the reader to see Eldorado as utopic?  Does Voltaire have a philosophical lesson in mind or is it pure satire? Or both?</span></span> How does it correspond to your personal view of Utopia? <span class="style4">Quote from the text with examples to support your answers and include the page reference for each quotation.</span></p>
<p class="style14">See Lecture Notes on <a href="222dulce.html">Dulce et utile</a>.</p>
<p class="style14">The first original contribution post&mdash;on Pope&mdash;is due Friday at midnight. You will have many authors to choose from to do your required 13 posts (7 original contributions and 6 responses), but I encourage you to get in the habit of posting by starting with Pope or Voltaire. For an original contribution post, make a point or develop an argument of at least 7 lines based on something you read, learned or thought while reading <em>An Essay on Man</em>. It can be helpful to ask a question or make a provocative statement for your classmates to respond to. Did something in your homework get praise or a lot of comment from me? If so, it might be the basis of a good post. <br />
    <br />
  Read Shannon, Chapter 2. </p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style7">Class 6 (Voltaire, Lecture 3)</span> <span class="style13">due Wednesday, January 21 </span><br />
  Read the page in Supplementary Materials, <a href="Candide%20quotes.html">Quotes from different critics about &quot;Il faut cultiver notre jardin.&quot; </a><br />
  Write a page answering the following questions: what are some  literal and figurative meanings of the word <em>garden</em>? How do they apply here? How do <strong>you</strong> interpret the final line of the story?What do I mean by <strong>literal</strong> and <strong>figurative</strong>? Here is an example I found online at <a href="http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm">http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm</a> : <br />
  <br />
  <strong>literal</strong> vs. <strong>figurative</strong> meaning - relates to the meanings of words and phrases or expressions. For example, &quot;She was all ears&quot; has a <strong>figurative</strong> meaning (She was listening intently) as well as a <strong>literal</strong> meaning (Her body was composed of ears or she had a huge set of ears). Read Shannon, Chapter 3 </p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style13">Extra credit opportunity:</span> <a href="Barack Obama's Inaugural Address.html">Barack Obama's Inaugural Address</a>. Watch and/or read this speech and write a page about it from a literary perspective. How did it entertain and instruct? What figures of speech or rhetoric were used? Any literary allusions? What was repeated and familiar? (Ideally, not too much will be strange or confusing.)</p>
<p class="style14">I signed up for a new word a day email because they have such cool quotes: <a href="http://wordsmith.org/awad/subscribe.html">http://wordsmith.org/awad/subscribe.html</a><br />
  If you need to build your vocabulary (taking the GRE?), it's a great way to learn about works. This week's theme is Words from Obama </p>
<p class="style14">A.Word.A.Day<br />
  with Anu Garg</p>
<p class="style14">Tomorrow Barack Obama will become president of the US, and not a moment too soon. This week we'll feature words from Obama, words from his books, speeches, and interviews.<br />
  <br />
  Unlike most politicians, who hire ghostwriters, Obama writes his own books. He's a gifted writer. Reading his words you can see his thought process. He's not one who sees the globe in black and white. He has lived outside the US and has been exposed to other cultures. He realizes that just because someone has a different set of beliefs, just because someone looks different, doesn't mean he's wrong -- sometimes there can be two ways to do something and both can be right.</p>
<p class="style14">Obama is to be commended for his accomplishments. We've come a long way in this country. But we still have far to go before we can call ourselves truly unbiased. Real progress will be when any capable person can have a fair chance at winning the highest office, even someone who happens to be, say, a black gay vegan atheist woman.</p>
<p class="style14">Anything is possible... but don't hold your breath.</p>
<p class="style14">cohere</p>
<p class="style14">PRONUNCIATION:<br />
  (ko-HEER) <br />
  MEANING:<br />
  verb intr.: To be united; to work or hold together. </p>
<p class="style14">ETYMOLOGY:<br />
  From Latin cohaerere, from co- (together) + haerere (to stick). </p>
<p class="style14">USAGE:<br />
  &quot;I learned to slip back and forth between my black and white worlds, understanding that each possessed its own language and customs and structures of meaning, convinced that with a bit of translation on my part the two worlds would eventually cohere.&quot;<br />
  Barack Obama; Dreams From My Father; Times Books; 1995. </p>
<p class="style14">A THOUGHT FOR TODAY:<br />
  I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. -Martin Luther King, Jr., civil-rights leader (1929-1968) </p>

    <br />
    Here are two additional, more modern, sets of critical questions you may choose to address. They were written by a former student, Garry Pigg (Fall, 2005)</p>
<p class="style33">ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM </p>
<p class="style14">1. How do the environmental/ecological conditions within the setting of the work affect the language, mood, tone, and theme?<br />
  2. How does the use of the word &quot;nature&quot; in the work reflect the current scientific beliefs of the time and how does that affect the characters, plot, themes?<br />
  3. How does the relationship between man/woman and his/her environment--economically, agriculturally, botanically, socially--affect the characters, language, theme, plot, and tone? i.e. do the characters have to hunt and gather, farm, trade, live in city, country?<br />
  4. How do plants, animals, and their conditions in the environment affect the character's livelihood, the plot, the author's tone, the moods, the theme? i.e. the effects of individual species such as cows, camels, horses,goats, bananas, sugar, cotton, corn, potatoes, fungi, bacteria,<br />
  viruses; and ambient conditions such as drought, flooding, pollution, climate change, introduction of invasive species, and famine.</p>
<p class="style33">QUEER THEORY </p>
<p class="style14">1. How do the cultural feelings about sex affect the characters, plot, and themes?<br />
  2. How does sexual identity affect the characters? How do they deal with others and their own sexual deviance or breaking of social norms?<br />
  3. How does homosexuality or bisexuality play a role in the characters' lives, the tone, mood, theme, and plot of the work?<br />
  4. What role does sexuality play in the work?  How does it affect the use of language? Does it represent love and beauty or marriage and<br />
  reproduction?<br />
  5. How does religion affect the tendencies of the characters to express or not express themselves sexually?<br />
  6. How does the work represent sex and sexuality?  Does it use sexuality to define &quot;others&quot;? Does discussion of sex in the work hinder or help feminism?  Does it hurt or help racism, discrimination in general, and civil rights?  What is the connection between sexuality, race, gender, and social class in the work(s)?</p>

      <span class="style31"><span class="style32"><span class="style3"><strong>&bull; FORMALIST CRITICISM</strong></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="style3"><br /> 
      -In <em>Madame Bovary</em>, we encounter a series of events which affect the lives of the characters. What are the different events that affect Emma's life throughout the story?<br />
      -How have the changes in setting throughout the story affected the main characters, Charles and Emma? Include the condition of their relationship, their attitudes towards one another, their overall attitudes, etc.
</span><span class="style20"><span class="style13"><span class="style4"><span class="style31"><span class="style32"><br />
</span></span></span></span></span><span class="style3">-What is Lheureux's association with Emma's death? </span><span class="style20"><span class="style13"><span class="style4"><span class="style31"><span class="style32"><br />
<br />
<strong>&bull; </strong></span></span><span class="style58">SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM<br />
 Marxist Criticism</span><span class="style32">:<br />
 -Were the
 actions of Lheureux a demonstation of the brutality and excess of the bourgeoisie? Is this evidence that the bourgeois class oppresses not only the proletariat but also their own?<br />
 -If 
 the setting of <em>Madame Bovary</em> focused on an ideal Marxist/Socialist society, all other things remaining equal, how might the tone and overreaching ideals of the story differ when framed from the philosophical standpoint of utilitarianism? For simplicity, utilitarianism can be defined as the attempt to maximize the cumulative happiness or satisfaction of all members of society where no individual's opinion may have a weighted difference from any other individual.<br />
 -Which elements of the higher social class does Emma admire?<br />
 -In what way does Flaubert associate the social class of the people in <em>Madame Bovary </em>with the actual presence of class they have in their soul?<br />
 -Do the people of Yonville treat Emma differently because of how she dresses and her social status? Does social class really affect the people of Yonville's opinions on one another?<br />
 -How do you think it would affect the story if Emma had been a farmer? Would Rodolphe and L&eacute;on still have fallen in love with her? Or what if she married a man from the ball? Would she have cheated?
 <br />
 <span class="style93"><br />
 </span></span></span></span></span><span class="style101"><strong>Feminist Criticism:</strong><br />
 - Is Emma&rsquo;s materialism and selfishness influenced by the way she pursues men to be more powerful, dominant and important in society?  Is she like this because she wants to feel like she is different, not necessarily special,  from the other women?  Or is that the only she sees fit in order to feel like she has some control over her own life in this man-dominated society? Or is she trying to shy away from the typical gendered roles of a women, such as being a devout wife and a good mother?</span><span class="style108"><br />
 </span><span class="style101">-Does Emma reject her role as a woman? We read on page 1089 that Emma desires to give birth to a son rather than a daughter beacuase men are &quot;free to range the passions and the world, to surmount obstacles, to taste the rarest pleasures&quot; whereas women are &quot;continually thwarted.&quot; In addition, we often observe Emma in boredom from the daily task of a woman. However, she loves fashion, doesn't want to work, and definitely pays the role of a naive female in her relationship with Rodolphe. Does Emma truly reject her role?<br />
 -Why did Flaubert decide to make Emma the more manipulative one in the relationship rather than Charles, although the man was supposed to play the more manipulative/ dominant role in marriages in society back then. Is it because Flabuert is a man and wants to make the male figure look better than the female?<br />
 -How do Emma's actions demonstrate her taste in men? Do you think Charles will ever fit in her &quot;ideal man&quot; category? Why?<br />
 -Emma is disappointed when she gives birth to a girl, because she knows she lives in a man's world and life is easier for men. In what ways is her behavior toward men (particularly Chrales, L&eacute;on, Rodolphe) a means to overcome the difficulties/barriers faced by women?<br />
 -How does Flaubert show his view on women in <em>Madame Bovary</em> espeicaly in the sense of their relationship with men? How do the women's actions and emotions reflect his views on women?<br />
 -Why do you think Flaubert had Emma be a cheater with so many other men? Do you think it has to do with Flaubert being a man?<br />
 -In the novel, Emma is bored with life, does not have a solid job or any type of career and cannot make up her mind who she is in love with. Why does Flaubert make women seem so useless, unfaithful, and indecisive? Does Emma like her role in life or does she want more out of her life?<br />
 -How does Emma reveal contemporary gender roles when she talks about why she would prefer to have a boy over a girl?<br />
 -In <em>Madame Bovary</em>, there is a scene where the sex of the baby is found out. It was a girl. Emma did not seem to be happy that she had bourne a girl. Why was this? Is this because of the time period in which the story takes place in which boys were more valued than girls? Does this reaction reflect on Emma or Charles in any way?
 </span><span class="style108"><br />
 -How are women's lives portrayed in <em>Madame Bovary</em>?<br />
 -How does Flaubert feel about women and how does he bring his opinion into the story?<br />
 -Does Flaubert give women masculine qualities?<br />
 -Why does Flaubert
 choose to make women the main interest of his story? A woman is even the title of his story.<br />
 -Are women powerful or powerless in Flaubert's story?<br />
 -How are Emma's love affairs a metaphor of her mood and financial state?<br />
 -Emma says &quot;A woman is always thwarted&quot; from experiencing the world, feeling true passions and tasting the rarest pleasures. (1089) How do her negative feelings toward her own sex influence her actions and relationships in the private and public spheres?
 <br />
 -What makes the qualities portrayed in Emma, F&eacute;licit&eacute; and the elder Bovary (and other female characters) different form the qualities portrayed in Charles, L&eacute;on and Homais (and other male characters)? Do these characteristics hold true for the 19th century?<br />
 -How does Gustave Flaubert's opinion of women's role in society come out in the story?  Does he agree with the normal idea of a woman's role in his time? <br />
 <br />
 </span><span class="style6">&bull; <strong>CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM</strong></span> <span class="style6"><br />
-Was it a custom in 19th century France for parents to choose who their children married, as Charles's mother and father did for him when they selected his first wife?<br />
-If Flaubert actually wrote <em>Madame Bovary</em></span> <span class="style6">in the romantic period rather than the Realistic period, how different would it be? </span><span class="style20"><span class="style13"><span class="style4"><span class="style32"><br />
</span></span></span></span><span class="style6">-How does the work reflect the lives of people and their values in the period in which it was written? Are characters like Madame Bovary and Homais the reflection of typical human beings found in this historical period?<br />
-How does each character reflect different attributes of the nineteenth century realism? How does Emma represent a romantic character?
</span><span class="style20"><span class="style13"><span class="style4"><span class="style32"><br />
</span></span></span></span><span class="style6">-Romantic writers typically rejected rationalism and would portray this through their writing. How does Flaubert's rejction of rationalism show through Charles and Emma in <em>Madame Bovary</em>? </span><span class="style20"><span class="style13"><span class="style4"><span class="style32"><br />
</span></span></span></span><span class="style6">-How does Charles' approach to dealing with the loss of those close to him reflect the late 19th century?<br />
-Does Emma's affair with Leon have a significant purpose during this time period?<br />
-During the 1850s in France we saw a rise in the class known as the &quot;haute bourgeoisie.&quot; In what descriptions and with what characters can we see Flaubert's disgust towards this class of people?<br />
-<em>Madame Bovary</em> is considered the showpiece of French realism. How does <em>Madame Bovary</em> represent French realism and its time period (mid-1800s)? </span><span class="style20"><span class="style13"><span class="style4"><span class="style32"><br />
<br />
<span class="style91">&bull; 
    PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM<br />

For two possible explanations for Marcel's behavior, <br />

<br />
2) Also: &quot;The Oedipus complex in Freudian psychoanalysis refers to stage of psychosexual development in childhood where children of both sexes regard their father as an adversary and competitor for the exclusive love of their mother. The name of the complex derives from the Greek myth of Oedipus, who unwittingly kills his father Laius and marries his mother Jocasta.<br />
<br />
Freud considered the successful resolution of the Oedipus complex to be key to the development of gender roles and identity, with boys and girls resolving the conflicts differently as a result of castration anxiety and penis envy. Freud also held that the unsuccessful resolution of the Oedipus complex could result in neurosis and homosexuality.&hellip; Although common usage refers to 'suffering from an Oedipus complex', psychoanalysis does not consider the complex a pathology, but instead <strong>a perfectly normal stage that all children go through</strong>. Oedipal desires are thought to remain heavily repressed and unconsciously in the minds of all functioning adults.&quot; <br />

-Does Gregor's lack of income mean that it is his fault his family is struggling? <br />
-How are class differences presented in this work? Are the characters aware or unaware of the economic and social forces that affect their lives? <br />
  -How does their economic condition affect not only Gregory's life, but his family's lives as well? <br />
  -Is this  sudden change and  metamorphosis a result of the social and economic condition of Gregor&rsquo;s family and his surroundings?<br />
  -How does social class and economic standing affect the characters?<br />
  -Is the fact that Gregory turns into a bug an indication of his social and economic status?<br />

  <br />
  </span><span class="style6">&bull; <strong>CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM</strong></span> <span class="style6"><br />

    PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM<br />
  </span></span><span class="style105">-By all accounts, Gregor is seemingly a good, moral and caring person. He works off his parents' debt, has never taken a sick day, and is generally good to his family. Why did this metamorphosis happen and why does he seem so OK with it? </span><span class="style91"><strong><br />
  </strong></span></span></span></span><span class="style105">-How does <em>The Metamorphosis</em> reflect Kafka's personal psychology? His own life and problems?<br />
  -Can parents grow to accept and love a son that has transformed into a socially unaccpetable &quot;person&quot;? At what point will the emotions subside and acceptance occur? Can this transformation happen at all? </span><span class="style20"><span class="style13"><span class="style4"><span class="style91"><strong><br />

  -Does Kafka present psychological matters such as repression, dreams, and desire, either consciously or unconsciously?
  <br />
  -How does Gregor Sama's behavior change when he finds out he is alienated?<br />
  -Does Kafka identify with any of the characters in the story 
</span><span class="style20"><span class="style13"><span class="style4"><span class="style105"><em>The Metamorphosis</em>?</span><span class="style118"><span class="style115"><br />

</strong></span><span class="style105">-How does Gregor relate himself to his social situation?<br />
</span></span></span></span><span class="style105">-Kafka's <em>Metamorphosis </em>is unique in that it combines realism with the nightmarish as Gregory Samsa has changed into a giant bug. How did you respond to Kafka's writing style in relation to enjoyment and intepretation of the story?<br />
- How do you think Gregor feels when his parents neglect him although he provides for them financially? </span><span class="style20"><span class="style13"><span class="style4"><span class="style91"><strong><br />

  </span></span></span><span class="style93">-Even though it is impossible for a human to be magically transformed into an insect, how can the reader relate to Gregor Samsa?
    <br />
    -How does Kafka convey the gruesome detail of Greogroy's weird condition throughout the story?<br />
    -Have you ever felt like a bug, as in very different from anyone else?<br />
    -The reader does not know all of Gregory's most inner thoughts.   Describe how YOU think he is feeling on the inside (sad, scared, guilty, confused, etc).  When all is said and done, do you think he desires to be changed back into a human?  Is he hopeful and/or confident in his metamorphosis back to a human?    <br />
-Discuss the positives and negatives of being transformed into an insect. If you were to undergo such a transformation, what would you want to become?<br />
-In your opinion, do you think that Gregory actually turned into an insect or did HE believe he was changed into an insect?  Was it a result of imagination, dream, or insanity?<br />
-Thus far, what characters undergo changes (is Gregory the only one)?   Explain with examples.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="style20"><span class="style13"><span class="style4"><span class="style95">&bull; ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM <br />
  </span><span class="style96">-How does Gregor's job prioritize his emotions? <br />
  -How do the environmental conditions in the introductory part of the story affect the mood of the story? <br />
-Why does Kafka change Gregory into an insect out of all the creatures on the planet? </span></span></span></span></p>

  </span></span></span></span><span class="style98">After Gregor experiences his change into a large insect, he is no longer able to work, leave his room or do much of anything for himself. What impact does this metamorphosis have on gender roles and roles of authority within the Samsa household?<br />
    Why did Kafka choose to establish Gregory's lack of romantic relationships first and why is that significant in his isolation?  </span><span class="style20"><span class="style13"><span class="style4"><span class="style96"><br />

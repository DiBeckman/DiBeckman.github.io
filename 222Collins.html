<p class="style1">Here are two poems by former Poet Laureate of the United States, Billy Collins. <br />
  <br />
  <em><strong>Introduction to Poetry</strong></em><br />
Billy Collins</p>
<p class="style1">I ask them to take a poem<br />
  and hold it up to the light<br />
  like a color slide</p>
<p class="style1">or press an ear against its hive.</p>
<p class="style1">I say drop a mouse into a poem<br />
  and watch him probe his way out,</p>
<p class="style1">or walk inside the poem's room<br />
  and feel the walls for a light switch.</p>
<p class="style1">I want them to waterski<br />
  across the surface of a poem<br />
  waving at the author's name on the shore.</p>
<p class="style1">But all they want to do<br />
  is tie the poem to a chair with rope<br />
  and torture a confession out of it.</p>
<p class="style1">They begin beating it with a hose<br />
  to find out what it really means.</p>
<p class="style2">from The Apple that Astonished Paris, 1996<br />
  University of Arkansas Press, Fayetteville, Ark.<br />

<p class="style1"><em><strong>Taking Off Emily Dickinson's Clothes</strong></em><br />
-- Billy Collins</p>
<p class="style1">First, her tippet made of tulle,<br />
  easily lifted off her shoulders and laid<br />
  on the back of a wooden chair.</p>
<p class="style1">And her bonnet,<br />
  the bow undone with a light forward pull.</p>
<p class="style1">Then the long white dress, a more<br />
  complicated matter with mother-of-pearl<br />
  buttons down the back,<br />
  so tiny and numerous that it takes forever<br />
  before my hands can part the fabric,<br />
  like a swimmer's dividing water,<br />
  and slip inside.</p>
<p class="style1">You will want to know<br />
  that she was standing<br />
  by an open window in an upstairs bedroom,<br />
  motionless, a little wide-eyed,<br />
  looking out at the orchard below,<br />
  the white dress puddled at her feet<br />
  on the wide-board, hardwood floor.</p>
<p class="style1">The complexity of women's undergarments<br />
  in nineteenth-century America<br />
  is not to be waved off,<br />
  and I proceeded like a polar explorer<br />
  through clips, clasps, and moorings,<br />
  catches, straps, and whalebone stays,<br />
  sailing toward the iceberg of her nakedness.</p>
<p class="style1">Later, I wrote in a notebook<br />
  it was like riding a swan into the night,<br />
  but, of course, I cannot tell you everything -<br />
  the way she closed her eyes to the orchard,<br />
  how her hair tumbled free of its pins,<br />
  how there were sudden dashes<br />
  whenever we spoke.</p>
<p class="style1">What I can tell you is<br />
  it was terribly quiet in Amherst<br />
  that Sabbath afternoon,<br />
  nothing but a carriage passing the house,<br />
  a fly buzzing in a windowpane.</p>
<p class="style1">So I could plainly hear her inhale<br />
  when I undid the very top<br />
  hook-and-eye fastener of her corset</p>
<p class="style1">and I could hear her sigh when finally it was unloosed,<br />
  the way some readers sigh when they realize<br />
  that Hope has feathers,<br />
  that reason is a plank,<br />
  that life is a loaded gun<br />
  that looks right at you with a yellow eye.</p>

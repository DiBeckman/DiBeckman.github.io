  <br />
ISTJ types like to be accurate, and they usually are. Others can go to the bank on an ISTJ's promise to provide practical information. The data will be clear, on time (if not early), and exactly in the form promised. They are among the most reliable and dependable members of any group.</p>

  <span class="style2"><br />

  <br />
  <span class="style2">Playing</span> <br />
  &bull; Usually prefer hands-on hobbies or projects they work on alone <br />
  &bull; 
  Like a neat room and hardworking, quiet, organized roommates <br />
  &bull; Report dating no more than once a month or are too busy to date<br />
  &bull;  
  Feel they must get all their work done before playing <br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2">Possible Causes of Stress </span><br />

  &bull; May be too perfectionistic about details <br />

  High school study techniques may not work in college <br />
  &bull; 
  May overwork and miss out on the fun of college  <br />
  &bull;
  As adults, may work so hard that their health suffers <br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2">Dealing with Stress </span><br />

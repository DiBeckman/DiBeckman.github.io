<p align="center" class="style4">1) <em>The Dead Part 2<br>
</em>by Drew Thomas </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gabriel awoke the next morning to a subtle touch on his leg. Rolling over to investigate, he realized that there was hand placed on his leg, that was not Gretta&rsquo;s! Startled by this notion, he sat up with great haste, but soon realized it was in fact his own hand. He had been unable to decipher the difference as his arm was completely numb. He had slept on his shoulder and lost feeling in his right arm. Gretta, startled by this commotion, began to stir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong Gabriel?&rdquo; She asked</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh nothing, I slept on my arm and it startled me&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gabriel, rising from the bed, walked towards the window and stood there motionless. His arm had begun to tingle as it regained feeling. The snow was falling ever so slowly and had accumulated at the base of the window. His mind began to wander as he watched the children throw snowballs at each other in the street.</p>
<p>As his mind wandered he couldn&rsquo;t help but think about Michael Furey and the conversation he had had the night before with his wife. The name Michael Furey would forever haunt his mind. It was as if Gretta believed him to be a martyr to love. Gabriel felt sick to his stomach from these thoughts and turned away from the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why have you never told me about Michael Furey?&rdquo; Gabriel asked, walking towards the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was so long ago I really don&rsquo;t like to talk about it&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Gabriel said nothing; it was hard for him to believe that his plans for a romantic evening had been utterly destroyed by the memory of rival. I must do something to make her forget about him, he thought to himself. I can&rsquo;t let the memory of Michael Furey overshadow our marriage. He could tell she was still thinking about her dead lover by the way she stared blankly towards the couch. The awkward silence was broken by the call of the porter; it was now 8 o-clock.&nbsp; They began to gather their belongings and preparing for their trip home. Gabriel went down to the front desk to check out and pay their bill while Gretta waited patiently in the hotel room. When Gabriel returned Gretta was stretched out on the bed with her arm across her body and her hand placed on her forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like it if I skipped my cycling trip this year and went on vacation? You told me yesterday you wished to visit Galway, or we could even go home to Connacht. How would you like that Gretta?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said nothing; her thoughts were elsewhere, noticing this Gabriel began to become frustrated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; she said, rising to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh nothing&rdquo; he said in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No really, what was it you said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was suggesting that we go on vacation to Galway, possibly Aran Isle&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really Gabriel!&rdquo; she said with an excitement that lifted Gabriel&rsquo;s heart. He had not seen her smile since his speech at the dinner table. </p>
<p>&ldquo;If it would make you happy, I will take you this summer&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would love it if we could walk along Corrib1, it is so beautiful when the sun sets&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can have dinner and walk along the promenade&rdquo; said Gabriel</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A look of satisfaction filled Gabriel&rsquo;s face. He had successfully directed Gretta&rsquo;s thoughts away from Michael Furey and towards their future together. It brought a flicker of hope back into their relationship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go fetch a cab&rdquo; said Gabriel</p>
<p>They left at once and for the time being everything seemed agreeable. The more they discussed their vacation, the happier Gretta was. She had not been to Galway since she was a child. She stayed many summers there with her Aunt and Uncle who worked at a prestigious fish market known for their porbeagle2. She told stories of how she would watch the fisherman throw the days dying bait over the peer, waiting for the sharks to appear from the midst of the dark water. Gretta would spend her summers making geansa&iacute;3, which would be sold at her Uncle&rsquo;s market. Fisherman traveled from all over Galway to purchase her renowned work.</p>
<p>As they approached home they began to discuss what they would do for dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lets go to Brandubh&rsquo;s for dinner, what do you say?&rdquo; said Gabriel</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Gabriel, you know how expensive that is? I thought we were going on vacation. We&rsquo;ll never be able to afford all this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sparked by romance, Gabriel had no worries about money. His only wish was to make the love of his happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know they always have live music on Fridays&rdquo; she said</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes you see there&rdquo; Gabriel said to the cab driver, pointing towards Brandubh&rsquo;s</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the crowd of people sir&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rdquo; Yes drop us off there, that will be fine&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brandubh&rsquo;s was walking distance from their house and he insisted they be dropped off immediately. Gabriel paid the driver and worked his way through the crowd to make reservations. To his and Gretta&rsquo;s delight the crowd was leaving, it had apparently been someone&rsquo;s birthday. Gabriel could hardly tell her the good news because all they could hear was. </p>
<p><em>&ldquo;When the wedding bells are ringing his the breat to lead the singing<br>
  then in jigs the folks go swinging what a splendid piper<br>
  He will blow from eve to morn counting sleep a thing with scorn<br>
  old is he but not outworn know ye such a piper&rdquo; </em>4 </p>
<p>The gentleman whose birthday it was stumbled and fell in the snow, laughing at himself for being so screwed5. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see that fellow? He needs to go home before he catches pneumonia&rdquo; said Gretta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I did, they&rsquo;re calling for us now&rdquo;</p>
<p>Escaping the cold they found their way to their table, which to Gretta&rsquo;s delight was a short distance away from the piano. There was an old man dressed in an all white tuxedo, heading towards the piano. He had white hair with a white curly mustache that ever so slightly covered the scar on his right cheek.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;My name is McNeil, can I get you some crubeens6 or porter7?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No thank you, we&rsquo;d like a bottle of your finest wine&rdquo; said Gabriel</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Most certainly sir&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you thinking Gabriel? That could cost more then our meal!&rdquo; Gretta said</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lets live a little; we never do anything spontaneous&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a simple nod she had to agree. Their daily life had become so dull and passionless, she too, was living in the moment. The candlelight set the mood and the pianist began to play. The candlelight flickered in their faces as they talked of their vacation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it our second honeymoon&rdquo; he said leaning across the table to give her a kiss. Her eyes fluttered with the innocence of a young girl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you know what you&rsquo;d like to eat sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get the <a name="lambroast">Uaineoil Faoi Chrusta</a>8&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Gabriel could finish his sentence the piano strings hit a harmony that unnerved his soul. Wide eyed and in disbelief, Gabriel turned, the pianist was playing &ldquo;The Lass of Aughrim.&rdquo; Gretta sat with her hands in her face looking towards the table. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Ill give you &pound;5 to stop playing that dreadful song&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sir, that man over there gave me &pound;5 to play it&rdquo; said the pianist.</p>
<p>At that moment Gabriel came to the realization that he would never be able to escape the taunting memories of Michael Furey. Gabriel felt as if his heart had just dissolved, leaving him empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you &pound;10!&rdquo; Gabriel yelled over the pianist&rsquo;s lyrics</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&rdquo; said the pianist</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It was my son&rsquo;s favorite song&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p class="style2"><br>

  2 ) Gabriel&rsquo;s Second Epiphany<br>
  by  Kristen Morrison</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gabriel awoke from the uncomfortable warmth of the thick, plush sheets that restrained him in the hotel bed.&nbsp; He looked bemusedly at his sleeping wife while he softly brushed the hair from her eyes with his fingertips.&nbsp; As he did so he began to remember the events from the night before and quietly rose from the bed leaving her side and walked slowly over to the window.&nbsp; The snow had stopped falling and dim, yellow light was shining into the shadowy room from the rising sun.&nbsp; Gabriel gazed paralyzed from the sight of the great white landscape that lay before him.&nbsp; Moments later he placed his warm cheek on the cool glass of the window trying to sort out his multifarious feelings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Gabriel arrived at the house, he was confronted with warm laughter and the smell of fresh paint from the newly painted hunter green walls in the hallway.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was considerably younger but still had the restless eyes covered by the gilt rimmed glasses he wore today.&nbsp; A friend of Gretta&rsquo;s had invited her to an evening gathering on one particularly cool spring night; the same gathering Gabriel was attending.&nbsp; Gabriel first caught sight of Gretta as she was gracefully hanging up her simple but sensible coat on the mahogany hooks in the hostess&rsquo;s foyer.&nbsp; She noticed him eyeing her and gave him a friendly smile.&nbsp; This smile sent a wave of intensity through Gabriel who instantly felt the desire to speak with this woman.&nbsp; When he regained his will to talk he called out to her but she had already left the room to join the rest of the party.&nbsp; The guests sat down as dinner plates full of steaming corned beef, potatoes and cooked cabbage were being set in front of each place.&nbsp; Gabriel and Gretta sat at adjacent ends of the large table where he allowed himself to look at her through the corner of his eye, which subtly moved over her refined hands, slim arms, and inviting red lips.&nbsp; As usual his friends solicited him until he agreed to tell the story about his foolish professor from his second year at The Royal University that they amazingly still found funny after so many retellings.&nbsp; When he had finished the story he heard a sincere but quiet laugh escape Gretta&rsquo;s mouth, and was given a feeling of satisfaction.&nbsp; By the time everyone had cleared their plates he had engaged in an affable conversation with Gretta.&nbsp; He guided her to the porch where she hesitantly followed.&nbsp; Outside on the porch Gabriel noticed how the gray clouds overhead were subtly lit by the moon set high in the black night sky.&nbsp; This same light illuminated Gretta&rsquo;s graceful features in a mysterious way.&nbsp; As everyone was saying their goodbyes and preparing to leave Gabriel slipped Gretta&rsquo;s coat over her small shoulders and asked her if she would accompany him to dinner one night.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Gabriel remembered watching as she neared the exit without giving him an answer.&nbsp; She stepped outside though the open door and turned her head to look at Gabriel before she left with an air of regret told him her answer.&nbsp; With a smile Gabriel recalled how she had told him no on that cool spring night of their first meeting.&nbsp; It was not until a few weeks later when they met again at a party that she finally agreed to let him take her out.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window no longer chilled his cheek and the room was almost completely filled with sunlight.&nbsp; He carried his thoughts over to the chair, which had not yet been touched with light.&nbsp; The petticoat that had been flung on it the night before now had fallen onto the floor in a heap.&nbsp; Gabriel collected Gretta&rsquo;s clothes from the floor and placed them on the corner of the bed she was still deeply asleep on.&nbsp; He followed the diamond shaped pattern on the mauve colored carpet back to the cushioned chair and with a muted squeak sat down and allowed his head to fall over the back of the chair resting his neck on its edge.&nbsp; After a few moments he raised his head again only to stare perplexedly into space.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why was it that in the past night only memories of intimacy were resurfacing into his thoughts? For the first time Gabriel boldly questioned whether he was wrong to want to remember only these moments and to forget the dull ones?&nbsp; The heliotrope envelope, the crowed platform, and the foyer where he watched her take her coat off for the first time was fresh in Gabriel&rsquo;s head and filled up the empty space he was staring into.&nbsp; As the light from the window crept slowly past Gabriel&rsquo;s feet, slightly warming his toes, he began to think about all the moments in his and Gretta&rsquo;s relationship that he had let slip to the dark recesses of his conscious. He noticed that her single boot that had reminded upright the night before had now fallen onto its side and inched his own foot over its smooth surface. A distant memory of Gretta dressing their once infant son and struggling to put a pair of tiny of blue shoes on his feet, materialized in his mind.&nbsp; He remembered watching this scene and after giving a lighthearted chuckle, holding the little boy&rsquo;s pink wiggly feet still so she could get the shoes on him.&nbsp; The light had become more intense and now inched up onto his legs.&nbsp; As he sat up, he took off his glasses and cleaned them with a corner of his shirt, then proceeded to rest his arms on his knees allowing his upper body to soak in the light&rsquo;s warmth.&nbsp; These memories no matter how banal made up his and Gretta&rsquo;s life together. Yes, together.&nbsp; Gretta through good times and bad had stayed by his side, she was the mother of his children, she was his wife and she was part of his identity, which he now no longer considered impalpable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though Michael Furey held a piece of Gretta&rsquo;s heart, Gabriel had come to believe he held the rest of it with the life they had shared thus far.&nbsp; He loved his wife, he was a loyal husband and now appreciated the life they lived as a couple even the extended moments of everyday routine, and he believed that this was just as honorable as Michael Furey&rsquo;s passionate death.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the corner in his chair, Gabriel saw Gretta awaken and sit up against the bed&rsquo;s oak headboard.&nbsp; A beam of light shown across her rosy cheeks making her look more alive than ever.&nbsp; She looked at the empty space in the bed beside her and let her eyes travel around the room until they found Gabriel. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Come lay with me Gabriel for just a little while longer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without a word Gabriel rose from his chair and glanced out through the window.&nbsp;&nbsp; A world full of life now greeted him filling his soul with joy.&nbsp; Gabriel gracefully inched his way over to Gretta&rsquo;s side and embraced her with a passionate kiss that she willingly returned.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="center">On the ride back to Monkstown Gabriel&rsquo;s mind was peppered with thoughts of his and Gretta&rsquo;s future together in Ireland, which amalgamated with thoughts of going to the continent.&nbsp; This could be the vital change in their lives that he desperately needed.&nbsp; When they returned home he would finally suggest to Gretta that they make the permanent move to Europe, which until now never had the courage to make.<br>

<p align="center" class="style4">3)<em> Through the Eyes of Gretta:<br>
  The Piano Scene</em><br>
by Ariel Furlough
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style7"><em>Gabriel advanced from the little pantry behind the office, struggling into his overcoat and, looking round the hall, said:</em></span></p>
<p class="style7"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Gretta not down yet?</em></p>
<p class="style7"><em>- She&rsquo;s getting on her things, Gabriel, said Aunt Kate.</em></p>
<p class="style7">Upstairs Gretta began to hear the sound of someone playing the piano.&nbsp; The music was so soft and beautiful.&nbsp; It reminded her of something, but she couldn&rsquo;t remember exactly what it was.&nbsp; She continued to get her belongings together and then it hit her.&nbsp; A face flashed before her eyes.&nbsp; The song reminded her of her first love, Michael Furey.&nbsp; He was everything.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style7">- Why didn&rsquo;t I just stay in Galway, she thought.&nbsp; But, he should have known better than to come out in the rain?&nbsp; He was so sick, what was he thinking?&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style7">She paused for a moment.</p>
<p class="style7">- If only I had went to see him during the day then he wouldn&rsquo;t have died, and I would be with him.&nbsp; I would be happy, why did he leave me?&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style7">As the music continued, Mr. D&rsquo;Arcy voice sang out with hoarseness and in pain words that expressed a moment of grief:</p>
<p class="style7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>O, the rain falls on my heavy locks</em></p>
<p class="style7"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the dew wets my skin,</em></p>
<h1 class="style7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My babe lies cold&rsquo;&hellip;</h1>
<p class="style7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tears began to fall down her face as she listened.&nbsp; Michael used to sing that song for me.&nbsp; The <em>Lass of Aughrim</em> was the name of it.&nbsp; This man had given up the world to be with her and she could not accept that.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style7">- I was so selfish, she began to think, why didn&rsquo;t I realize what he was doing for me.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style7">- I should have never left home.</p>
<p class="style7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sat down on the bed, and slowly began to reach inside of the pocket of her coat.&nbsp; From it she retrieved a small piece of paper.&nbsp; It was a letter that she had written for Michael.</p>
<p class="style7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Dear Michael,</em></p>
<p class="style7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am writing this letter to tell you of my leaving.&nbsp; I have chosen to leave Galway and go to the convent in Dublin.&nbsp; Unfortunely, I will not be able to return until summer.&nbsp; I know of your illness and hope that you will be strong for me until I am able to return.&nbsp; Michael, I love you and want to be with you.&nbsp; I will cherish the walks that we took in the country on those warm spring days.&nbsp; And I will always remember the way that you used to sing for me during those cold, winter nights.&nbsp; Your voice was so delicate, and warm.&nbsp; While in the convent I will pray each night for your health, in hope that we will be together again upon my return.&nbsp; Be strong for me Michael; be strong for us.</p>
<p class="style7"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With love,</em></p>
<p class="style7"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gretta</em></p>
<p class="style7"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>It was too late.&nbsp; She was too late.&nbsp; If only she had stayed with Michael in Galway, he would still be alive, and she could be back home in Ireland.&nbsp; She slowly stood up and walked towards the window.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style7">- Oh how I loved Ireland.&nbsp; It is so pure and natural, not like Dublin and surely not at all like the Continent.&nbsp; The innocence of the world doesn&rsquo;t seem to be present here.</p>
<p class="style7">Outside the snow began to fall harder and faster.&nbsp; As Gretta looked up from the letter she noticed that it was no longer snowing, instead it was raining.&nbsp; She noticed in the distance that a man was walking into the driveway.&nbsp; Why was he out in this weather?&nbsp; Gretta then began to get the feeling that she had seen this person before.&nbsp; The rain had drenched his clothes.&nbsp; It was Michael.&nbsp; What was he doing here?&nbsp; He should be at home in his condition.&nbsp; Gretta turned from the window anxiously wanting to tell Michael that he should go home.&nbsp; She looked back to make sure he was still there, and caught a reflection of herself in the window.&nbsp; She had aged.&nbsp; No longer was she the carefree Gretta that she remembered back in Galway.&nbsp; Her youthfulness had disappeared. </p>
<p class="style7">- Why did Michael risk his life that night for me?&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t I go to see him that day before I left?&nbsp; Then he would still be alive?&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style7">The more she thought about it, the faster the tears began to fall.&nbsp; But she could not think of that now because this was her life.&nbsp; Gabriel was her husband, and this was what he wanted.&nbsp; She folded the letter and placed it back inside of her coat, and wiped the tears from her eyes.</p>
<p class="style7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She slowly walked towards the landing wondering what was she to tell of this to Gabriel.&nbsp; Could she keep her love for Michael Furey a secret?&nbsp; Is it a sin for her to be with one man, but live with the burning memory of another?&nbsp; Gretta leaned against the banister to gather herself and glanced down to the bottom of the stairs.&nbsp; There was her husband.&nbsp; Gabriel was gazing up at her, but it was difficult to figure out what he was thinking because of the shadow that moved across him.&nbsp; He is a wonderful man that will do anything for our children and me.&nbsp; What would he think if I were to share my memories and grief for Michael?&nbsp; Would he be angry?&nbsp; Would he understand?</p>
<p class="style7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The piano closed suddenly, and Mr. D&rsquo;Arcy and Miss O&rsquo;Callaghan began to gather their things to leave.</p>
<p class="style7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Is he coming down, Gretta?</p>
<p class="style7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Yes, she answered and began to walk down the staircase towards her husband.</p>
<p class="style7">- Is everything all right, honey?</p>
<p class="style7">- Yes, Gabriel, everything is fine.</p>
<p class="style7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had never heard her husband call her that before.&nbsp; What caused this change?&nbsp; Maybe Gabriel is the perfect man for her.&nbsp; Everyone gathered in front of the front door waiting for the cab to arrive.</p>
<p class="style7">- What was the name of the song that you were singing? Mary Jane asked Mr. D&rsquo;Arcy.</p>
<p class="style7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - It&rsquo;s called <em>The Lass</em>&hellip; -</p>
<p class="style7">- <em>The Lass of Aughrim</em>, interrupted Gretta.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry I shouldn&rsquo;t have interrupted you.</p>
<p class="style7">- That&rsquo;s fine, Gretta.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m pleased to see someone that has an interest in the song.</p>
<p class="style7">- I didn&rsquo;t know that you knew that song, Gretta. said Gabriel surprised.</p>
<p class="style7">- Oh, its nothing, I remember hearing it when I was back home in Galway.</p>
<p class="style7">Noticing that the cab had arrived, she started to move them towards the front door where goodnights were said:</p>
<p class="style7">- Well, goodnight, Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia, and thanks for such a wonderful evening.</p>
<p class="style7">- Goodnight, Gretta.&nbsp; Goodnight, Gabriel!&nbsp; Do come by again soon.</p>
<p class="style7">- We sure will Aunt Kate.&nbsp; Goodnight.&nbsp; Goodnight, Aunt Julia, thanks for everything.</p>
<p class="style7">The scene ends with Mr. D&rsquo;Arcy, Miss Callaghan, Gabriel, and Gretta gathering into the cab.&nbsp; The morning is still dark, and there is a slight dampness in the air.&nbsp; While walking to the cab, the newly fallen snow melted underneath their footsteps, and the sunrise began to appear over the roofs of the nearby houses.</p>

<p align="center" class="style4">4) <em>A Letter from Gabriel to Gretta of &ldquo;The Dead&rdquo;</em><br>
by Camille Magnana </p>
<p>My Dearest Gretta,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is as if I have been blind for the last couple of years of our marriage.&nbsp; I have been living an ignorant life, unable to see how much strain I have put in our relationship in the past. &nbsp;Last night as I watched you listen to Mr. D&rsquo;arcy perform the <em>Lass of Aughrim</em> it was as if I saw you in a different light.&nbsp; I was incapable of even recognizing that the woman who stood in the shadow of the staircase was my beautiful wife.&nbsp; I have been caught up with my writing and focusing solely on myself that I have failed to see how cold and distant I have been to you.&nbsp; To hardheartedly turn you down with the idea of taking a trip to the Aran Isles and for you to visit your people&rsquo;s home, how much more aloof can I be to you?&nbsp; I have been so oblivious to the fact that I have estranged myself from you and that all I&rsquo;ve been able to think about is to comfort myself and find what makes me happy.&nbsp; I have forgotten that despite all the luxury that material possessions may offer, there is truly only one thing that can make me happy, and that is to have you in my life, my love.&nbsp; </p>
<p>As I watched you sleep peacefully, I felt grief, pain, and anger.&nbsp; All in which consumed me at once.&nbsp; I am sorry for the lost of Michael Furey and how much pain it caused you.&nbsp; I now understand that your love for him continues to this day and that his sacrifice was noble.&nbsp; More noble than most men can do in their lifetime.&nbsp; You had that romance in your life and I have merely played a poor part.&nbsp; I saw it over in my head, the scene that played in which Michael Furey stood before you shivering in the cold rain professing his love for you.&nbsp; My darling, I can accept that a part of you died with Michael, but you must not wholly blame yourself for his death.&nbsp; As you described to me, his health was already in decline.&nbsp; I watched you sleep in all your beauty, and for the first time in my life, I felt compassion and I held the same grief that you did.&nbsp; I grew frustrated at the thought that I have been so narcissistic as to only have the slightest hint of your past.&nbsp; Your tears, as they poured down your cheeks, became my tears too.&nbsp; I felt your loss and all the weight that you had been carrying all these years was mine.&nbsp; I have never felt this way for anyone and I thought to myself, this must be love.&nbsp; And just as Shakespeare had described, when &ldquo;Love speaks, the voice of all the gods makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.&rdquo;&nbsp; For the first time I understood what he really meant (&hellip;.how would Gabriel describe this, he&rsquo;s a writer, not the most romantic type, how how how?)</p>
<p>Darling, I want the chance to have a new start.&nbsp; If I could go back, I would start all over again and show how much love I have for you.&nbsp; To truly get to know you, to know all the things that make you smile and laugh.&nbsp; To know all the things that you love and most importantly to have the opportunity to spend more time with you, all of this is what I long for.&nbsp; I have been lost and blind all these years and now that my eyes are open, I want to make you happy to relive every moment with you is what I long for.&nbsp; Gretta, it is not too late for us to give our relationship one more try.&nbsp; To start anew, get away from the hustle of Dublin, even visit Galway, darling.&nbsp; You are what is the most important to me.&nbsp; I cannot live without your touch, thoughts, and love.&nbsp; Though we can no longer relinquish the past, we have the future ahead of us, my love.</p>
<p>With all my love,</p>
Your Gabriel

<p class="style5">The Travel Journal:</p>
<p class="style2">Please check out the examples from Edward Austen&rsquo;s (Jane Austen&rsquo;s brother) on electronic reserve for the class for examples of how a typical 18th century &ldquo;Grand Tour&rdquo; travel journal was written.  <span class="style1"><a href="https://reserves.lib.ncsu.edu/reservesViewer.php?reserve=157817">https://reserves.lib.ncsu.edu/reservesViewer.php?reserve=157817</a> or you can access it <a href="SpenceJoned_JaneAustensBrotherAbroad_6406.pdf">here </a></span>.</p>
<p class="style2">The Grand Tour for Englishmen usually started in Paris which &ldquo;served as a kind of finishing school for the young English aristocrat, offering social refinements as well as academic subjects [Turner and Ash, 33].   Then the young men went on to Greece and Rome to study past great historic and cultural iconic cities. You might also want to check out Francis Bacon&rsquo;s essay <a href="http://www.authorama.com/essays-of-francis-bacon-19.html">OF TRAVEL</a> considered &ldquo;probably the best summary of this official view of the Grand Tour . . .&rdquo; [Turner and Ash, 34].</p>
<p class="style2"><span class="style5">What you should write about every day while you are in Paris:</span></p>
<p class="style2">You must include an entry every day you are in Paris, but also need to write down your thoughts and plans prior/post trip.  You may want to comment for example on the visits to the wine tastings, the French meal at Ellen and Mike&rsquo;s, a French meal you cook, or even how you are incorporating practicing your French as you get ready for the trip.</p>
<p class="style2"><span class="style2">- Make a list of the 10 things you want to do while you're in Paris. As you do them, check them off. </span><span class="style5"><br />
  </span><span class="style2">- What question did you ask in French today? Write down your question, the answer you received and rate the exchange (successful or unsuccessful?) <br />
- What did you see or do today that relates to your paper topic?</span><br />
- Reflect on your experience with technology while in Paris. (For Matthew's research) <br />
- Bring the names of the four paintings you will look for at the four major museums (Cluny, Louvre, Orsay, Pompidou). How does seeing the work in person compare to studying it in the US? <br />
- Make it your mission to find the best p&acirc;tisserie (pastry) in Paris. You'll have to do a lot of taste-testing. Write down the names of the p&acirc;tisseries that you sample. See <a href="http://mac.softpedia.com/progScreenshots/La-Patisserie-Screenshot-52421.html">http://mac.softpedia.com/progScreenshots/La-Patisserie-Screenshot-52421.html</a> for examples of some tasty treats to try. </p>
<p class="style2">Besides writing something every day in Paris, you are to include maps/drawings (3 minimum).  The drawings can be of architecture, a work of art, a market scene, whatever moves you that you feel is important to remember about Paris.  If you have questions, see Drs. Beckman and Gustke.  If you decide you want to do your journal electronically, consult  Matthew.  The journal can incorporate postcards, photographs, brochures, but not at the expense of the written word.  Thinking about what you have experienced each day and writing about it is invaluable in retaining that memory for the future. </p>
<p class="style2">Here are additional prompts for each day that we are in Paris:</p>
<p class="style2">Samedi 13/3: What is the first thing you noticed about France and Paris upon arrival? (Whether this is your first or sixth visit.) Notice the scale of the cars and buildings in and around the hotel and when we go to dinner. Compare and contrast with Raleigh. Do Paris and France live up to your expectations so far.</p>
<p class="style2">Dimanche 14/3 What information about Paris/French history did you learn on the bike tour?</p>
<p class="style2">If the weather cooperates, we will go to the Eiffel Tower. The Eiffel Tower was built to be temporary. What does this mass of steel say about Paris? Why do you think it has become a symbol of the city? Compare your impressions of the Eiffel Tower with how you imagined it to be.</p>
<p class="style2">Lundi 15/3 After our walking tour and visit to the Cluny Museum, what most impressed you about medieval Paris? How does what you have seen and learned compare to the medieval film you watched?</p>
<p class="style2">Mardi 16/3 Based on what we learned on the walking tour, how did the French Revolution influence the development of Paris?</p>
<p class="style2">Mercredi 17/3 Why do you think IM Pei chose a pyramid for the Louvre courtyard? Does it clash with or enhance the visual experience of the exterior of the Louvre? Explain.</p>
<p class="style2">How is the experience of seeing Ionesco's plays performed live in Paris different from reading them in Raleigh? </p>
<p class="style2">  Jeudi 18/3 If you were a member of Louis XIV's court, what would be your reaction to moving to Versailles? How did your experience of Versailles match up to what you saw in the film(s) you saw about this period. </p>
<p class="style2">Vendredi 19/3 What did you learn about  impressionism, and post-impressionism from visiting the Orsay? In particular, how does seeing the work you chose in the context of other works by the same artist or other artists from the same period affect how you see it? </p>
<p class="style2">If you are/were a artist, what would be the appeal of living and working in Montmartre?</p>
<p class="style2"> Samedi 20/3 How did you decide what sites to see today? How did your visits further your knowledge of Paris arts? <br />
  <br />
  Do buy yourself a nice journal, one you will be proud to look at and reread.  You may want a small pocket notepad or iPod Touch to record notes thoughout the day that can then be expanded on later.  And/or you can use photographs to remind you and write from these or even have a small recording device to let you remember items of interest.  Each student will be asked to post the best of photographs of each arrondissement on our Flickr site, maintained by Chandler. Our days in Paris will be so full you will find it difficult to recall all you did that day.  I would also recommend buying yourself a nice pen to record your thoughts.  It is more fun to write with a pen/pencils/gel pens you like.  You will take more time to gather your thoughts.</p>
<p class="style2">The plane ride home is a great opportunity to finish writing in your travel journal. If you are on the group flight, you can give your travel journal to Mme Beckman and if you aren't on the group flight or need more time, please turn your journal in to Dr. G. Our plan is to return them to you when we meet in early April to discuss your paper topic and research. </p>

<p class="style4">Chandler also recommends a few sites to visit if you haven't purchased your travel journal yet. </p>
<p class="style4"><a href="http://www.moleskine.com/">Moleskine</a> offers a pretty wide variety of journals, etc. and they're worth looking into. Especially this one, which looks pretty much perfect for our trip:</p>
<p class="style4"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moleskine-City-Notebook-Paris-Pocket/dp/888370620X/ref=br_lf_m_1000240801_1_7_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;s=books&amp;pf_rd_p=408167201&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_t=1401&amp;pf_rd_i=1000240801&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=1RXAFB3AB8705FGR4KCC">Moleskine City Notebook - Paris</a></p>
<p class="style4">It includes a metro map, alphabetic list of streets, sheets to plot out routes as well as plenty of space to write and lots of other cool extras.</p>
<p class="style4">Also worth mentioning are <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/">Field Notes</a>, they're nice and simple.</p>

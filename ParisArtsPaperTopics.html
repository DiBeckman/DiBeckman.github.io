<p><span class="style1"><strong>Inspector Jules Maigret</strong>, George Simeon's fictional Parisian policeman. &quot;Simenon wrote of a Paris &mdash; of its bistros and quartiers, of its Chief Inspector, criminals and policemen, and of its landladies, shopkeepers, and waiters &mdash; that did not exist. But it is patterned on a real world; the archetype is Paris of the 1930s. So this Paris is frozen; it is the same a decade before World War II as it is just after Viet Nam. It is a Paris that existed only in memory for most of the years that saw the publication of the Maigret stories. &hellip; The social rules of Maigret's world are discernable because the behavior is patterned. The social order is the same throughout all the books, and the rules that form the social order are also the same. The behavior that most clearly indicates the social structure is drinking.&quot; From an article about the drinks consumed in the Maigret novels, from coffee (47) to herb tea (2) and the social ramifications thereof: <a href="http://www.trussel.com/maig/gurr.htm">http://www.trussel.com/maig/gurr.htm</a> <br />

  Chapter 2.1.7 American writers in Paris<br />
  The lost generation: &quot;F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote <em>The Great Gatsby</em> (1925) in Valescure on the C&ocirc;te d'Azur in 
  1924 and, a year later, met Ernest Hemingway in Paris. Like Hemingway, American Modernist poet Ezra Pound settled in Paris in 1921. Another poet TS Eliot, would pop over periodically from London. Irishman James Joyce was an important part of the Lost Generation community; Ulysses (1922) was first published by Sylvia Beach's Shaekspeare &amp; Company bookshop on the left bank, where a clique of young writers would often hang out.&quot; In the 1950 and 60a, Paris attracted the American Beat writers. The big three were the poets Allen Ginsberg and Greogory Corso and the novelist William S. Burroughs. They lodged in what became know as the Beat Hotel, a Left Bank dive. . . </span></p>

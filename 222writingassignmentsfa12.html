  <h2 class="class">Class 2 (Pope, Lecture 1) <span class="date">due Monday, August 20</span></h2>
  <p> Complete your <a href="222Morereflections.pdf">More Reflections</a> form to turn in.</p>
  <p>Read the argument (summary) and first stanza of Pope's <span class="text">Essay on Man</span>. Write a page about the first stanza (lines 1-16) answering Shannon's 4 questions*.</p>
  <ol class="unspaced">
    <li>What is confusing?</li>
    <li>What is repeated?</li>
    <li>What is familiar?</li>
    <li>What is strange?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>*This and all subsequent references to Shannon are from Edward Shannon's <span class="text">The Prentice Hall Guide to Writing about Literature</span> (Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2002) which went out of print in 2010. I  replaced it with <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> as a textbook for our class.  </p>
  <p>Write a one-paragraph to one-page summary of Chapter 1 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>. Include the title of each chapter in your heading, since   it should reflect the main point of the chapter. Your summary should include the main points and any others that seem especially helpful or surprising to you. Some students prefer to an outline format or question format. (See <a href="222ShortGuideSample.pdf">this example</a> of a question format.) Outlining, writing questions, and summarizing are all useful skills. You may handwrite or type it, and you may include it on the same page with your discussion of the first stanza of <span class="text">Essay on Man.</span> Unlike the literature assignments, you may submit<span class="text"> A Short Guide</span> assignments electronically since I will not make extensive comments on them. If they are submitted electronically, they will be returned to you electronically. </p>
  <p> Print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222Enlightenment.html">The Enlightenment</a> and <a href="222GreatChain.html">The Great Chain of Being</a> if you want to use them to take notes.  </p>
<p>In addition, for this and the next assignment, take a look at  my web page on <a href="Explication.html"><em>Explication de Texte</em></a> and these web sites about figures of speech which are also listed on the handy <a href="222supmatf04.html">Supplementary Materials</a> page. These pages will  be useful for your <a href="222poetrypresentation.html">Poetry Presentation</a> due on <span class="date">September 10 </span>and<span class="date"> 12</span>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Here is <a href="http://grammar.about.com/od/terms/a/revquiz20terms.htm?p=1">a quiz</a> you can take to assess your knowledge of the &quot;Top 20 figures of speech&quot; by Richard Norquist.</li>
    <li> <a href="http://www.nipissingu.ca/faculty/williams/figofspe.htm">This site</a> contains figures of speech, thought, repetition, more than you can shake a stick at! Most examples are drawn from Shakespeare. </li>
    <li> <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/rhetoricaldevicesinsound.htm">This site</a> is very cool because it has sound clips and draws from a wide range of speeches, movies, and more to illustrate the Figures of Speech. For example, see and listen to quotes from Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln, and Neil Armstrong on <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/figures/antithesis.htm">the page about antitheses</a>.</li>
    <li>If you are a sci-fi fan, check out this <a href="http://io9.com/5930325/10-literary-devices-and-where-you-can-find-them-in-science-fiction?utm_source=io9+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=52381cfe6f-UA-142218-29&amp;utm_medium=email">Blog post</a>.</li>

<h2 class="class">Class 3 (Pope, Lecture 2) <span class="date">due Wednesday, August 22</span></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Read <span class="text">Essay on Man</span> and write a page about your stanza to turn in. In case you're not sure what a <em>stanza</em> is, you can look this and other literary terms up in our course <a href="222Glossary.html">Glossary</a>, the Glossary in Appendix B of <span class="text">A Short Guide to Writing About Literature</span>, or a web site such as <a href="http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms.html">http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms.html</a>. <br />
      <br />
Note that the Roman numerals I-X at the beginning of each stanza correspond to your assigned stanza number (not a page or line number). What is the stanza about? Give a one-sentence summary. Answer the Shannon's 4 questions. Also, what are the key words and images in the stanza? How does the stanza connect with the ideas of the Enlightenment we've discussed? What is  the attitude of the narrator? What is the role of nature, especially animals, if any appear in your stanza?</li>
    <li>Write a one-paragraph to one-page summary or outline of Chapter 2 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> to turn in. Take, correct, and turn in your answers to the Quiz in Appendix B  364ff of <span class="text">A Short Guide.</span></li>

        <li>Consider bookmarking an online dictionary, such as <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/">dictionary.com</a> or <a href="http://www.m-w.com/">Merriam-Webster</a> to make it easy to look up words you don't know. If you are doing the Reading Notebook, you can print out the definitions to include in your notebook. Do you like words or want to improve your vocabulary (GRE in your future?)? I recommend that you sign up for the free daily email from  Anu Gang <a href="http://wordsmith.org/awad/subscribe.html">A Word a Day</a>.</li>
      </ol>
<h2 class="class">Class 5 (Voltaire, Lecture 2) <span class="date">due Monday, August 27</span>        </h2>
<li> Discuss the following questions after you do the reading assignment (Chapters 14-22). Quote from the text with examples to support your answers and include the page reference for each quotation.
<ul>
            <li>Is Eldorado a genuine utopia or (in one critic's words) &quot;a colossal bore&hellip;satirized by Voltaire as foolish and futile&quot;?</li>
            <li>Which specific behaviors or institutions show us that Voltaire wants the reader to see Eldorado as utopic?</li>
            <li>Does Voltaire have a philosophical lesson in mind or is it pure satire? Or both?</li>
            <li>How does it correspond to your personal view of Utopia?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>See Lecture Notes on <a href="222dulce.html">Dulce et utile</a>.<br />
          <br />
</li>
        <li>Read Chapter 3 in <em>A Short Guide</em> and write a summary to turn in.<br />
          <br />
</li>
        <li>The first original contribution post&mdash;on Pope&mdash;is due <span class="date">tonight</span> at midnight. You will have many authors to choose from to do your required 13 posts (7 original contributions and 6 responses), but I encourage you to get in the habit of posting by starting with Pope or Voltaire. For an original contribution post, make a point or develop an argument of at least one  full paragraph (5-8 sentences) based on something you read, learned or thought while reading <em>An Essay on Man</em>. Ask a question or make a provocative statement for your classmates to respond to. You may also include a quote from the text under discussion or links to other web sites. Did something in your homework get praise or a lot of comment from me? If so, it might be the basis of a good post. 
          <h2><span class="class">Class 6 (Voltaire, Lecture 3)</span> <span class="date">due Wednesday, August 29</span></h2>
          <p>Read the page in Supplementary Materials, <a href="Candide%20quotes.html">Quotes from different critics about &quot;Il faut cultiver notre jardin.&quot;</a> Write a page which includes answers to the following questions: what are some  literal and figurative meanings of the word <em>garden</em>? How do they apply to Candide's garden? How do <strong>you</strong> interpret the final line of the story? </p>
          <p>To help you to understand the difference between <strong>literal</strong> and <strong>figurative</strong>, here is  an example I found online:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>literal</strong> vs. <strong>figurative</strong> meaning - relates to the meanings of words and phrases or expressions. For example, &quot;She was all ears&quot; has a <strong>figurative</strong> meaning (She was listening intently) as well as a <strong>literal</strong> meaning (Her body was composed of ears or she had a huge set of ears). <span class="citation"><a href="http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm">Literary Terms for English</a></span></p>
          </blockquote>

  <li>Choose any one of the following questions to answer and include the question with your answer. These questions would also inspire some good discussions in your Moodle posts.</li>

  <div class="maroon">
    <h3>FORMALIST CRITICISM:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Flaubert changes the tempo of <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> by describing certain events in great detail, others are briefly told. How does the form of <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> reflect this?</li>
      <li>How does the 
    binary opposition between Emma and Charles reenforce the moral of <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span>?</li></ul>
    </div>
    <h3>SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
    <div class="red">
      <h4>Marxist Criticism:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Is Emma solely responsible for her problem, or is she a victim of society? Regardless, is it easy to sympathize with her? Why or why not?</li>
        <li>What do Lheureux's actions say about the Capitalist economic system, and what does Emma and Charles' response to his actions show about Captialism's effects on society?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  <div class="purple">
    <h4>Feminist Criticism: </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>In what ways does Emma reject typical women's roles? What are her views on these roles? Is Emma a feminist or is she just unhappy?</li>
      <li>How does Emma's character compare to other women in this time period? Is she an accurate representation of women in this time period?</li>
      <li>How does Flaubert depict his overall message through the death of Charles and Emma? Could Emma's suicide been foreseen earlier in the story?<br />
      </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="teal">
      <h3>CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>How do Emma's fantasies of a cheating wife tell us about the cultural and historical references of the time? Was it the work of a realist woman? Was it the sign of a cultural change in progress rooted in the idea of realism?</li>
        <li>What historical events influenced Flaubert's life and led to an influence in his writing of <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span>? For example, why was he so against the middle-class and their values?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  <div class="orange">
    <h3>PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What does Flaubert's portrayal of Emma's depression and discontent with her husband illustrate about the author's personality?</li>
        <li>What do Emma's behavior and actions show about her psychological state? What is the author trying to convey by making her character the way that it is?</li>
        <li>Does Flaubert present psychological matters within Emma's character like dreams, repression, or desire? Is Emma conscious or unconscious when these matters are presented?</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="blue">
      <h3>READER RESPONSE CRITICISM:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Can you see yourself living during this time period? What are some aspects of life you can see yourself doing/not doing during this time?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  <div class="green">
    <h3>ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>How does the relationship between Emma and Rodolphe and their social environment affect the characters, plot and theme?</li>
      <li>How do you think Flaubert uses Nature to shape his characters in the story?</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
  <div class="fuchsia">
    <h3>QUEER THEORY: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Considering Emma and her relationships, does <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> reflect love and beauty or marriage and reproduction? </li>
      <li>Could Emma's deisre for passion from men be blamed on her upbringing by a single father?</li>
      <li>Would you agree that this novel contains an immense amount of sexuality? If so, would you agree or consider the fact that Emma may have a serious issue psychologically due to her personal and constant desires and needs for satisfaction in life through men and sex? (She really shows a never-ending dissatisfaction with her life; she constantly needs attention, luxurious items, men, sex, to feel good, to be accepted, to be rich, to be famous, to have the world at the palm of her hand, and so on.) Would you then agree that she may be narcissistic and may be infatuated with herself suggesting homosexuality?</li>

      <p>Now answer your own question, or another student's (see below), based on the <strong>whole</strong> story. In other words, how might we interpret the <span class="text">Metamorphosis</span> through the lens of Formalist, Marxist, Feminist&hellip; criticism? Think especially about the violin scene, the death scene and the final paragraph. </p>
<p>For fun, <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~ljordan/metamorphosis/"> check out</a>: Which character are you in The Metamorphosis? </p>
<p>&quot;We are all sentenced to solitary confinement inside our own skins, for life.&quot; Williams, Tennessee. Recommended reading: two articles  relate to what I'll call <a href="222Isolationandcontact.html">The Gerasim Effect</a>&mdash;<span class="text">The United States holds tens of thousands of inmates in long-term solitary confinement. Is this torture?</span> by Atul Gawande  and <span class="text">Comforter and Comforted in an Unfolding Mystery</span> by Nell Burger Kirst. These articles could lead to a potential paper topic.</p>
<div class="maroon">
  <h3>FORMALIST CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How does reading the story from Gregor's perspective affect the reader? How would this story be different if it were told from another point of view?</li>
    <li>How does Gregory's casual view of his situation affect the reader's perspective as they grapple with the concept of a human insect?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h3>SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
<div class="red">
  <h4>Marxist Criticism:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>How do economic conditions determine the characters' lives in <em>The Metamorphosis</em>?</li>
    <li>How does Gregor's transformation change his famiy in economic and  emotional ways now that they realize that they can't be dependent on him  and in fact he is now dependent on them?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="purple">
  <h4>Feminist Criticism:  </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>How does the title relate to feminist literature?</li>
    <li>How does living in a patriarchal society affect the women in the story? How do you know it is a patriarchal society?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="teal">
  <h3>CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>What role, if any, did World War I play in the development of <span class="text">The Metamorphosis</span> or the Expressionist movement?</li>
    <li>What are some of the characteristics of cultural and historical change that take place in the story?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="orange">
  <h3>PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Franz Kafka resented his father's overbearing nature and felt deprived of maternal love (1964). Do you think this is why he wrote the story and made himself become an insect? Or do you think Kafka had other intentions in writing <span class="text">The Metamorphosis</span>?</li>
    <li>What, if anything, do Gregor's actions after the metamorphosis reveal about his feelings toward himself and his family prior to the change?</li>
    <li>How does the work reflect the author's personal psychology?</li>
    <li>How did Kafka's life translate into the metamophosis? What are similar themes?</li>
    <li>How does Kafka present Gregor's psychological matters such a repressions, dreams, and desire either consciously or unconsciously?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="blue">
  <h3>READER RESPONSE CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Similar to Gregor's condition, have you ever felt like &quot;the bug&quot; in the room or in a situation with either peers or family? In your opinion, why is Gregor so alientated from his family and other people in general?</li>
    <li>How did you respond to the opening scene of the story and what did it set you up to expect from the remainder of the story?</li>
    <li>What do you think this story illustrates about Kafka's life?</li>
    <li>Why is there no reason given for his transformation?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="green">
  <h3>ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How does Gregory's phsycial transformation mimic the claustrophobic environment he is bound to in the story?</li>
    <li>Why out of all the possible insects or animals  that Gregor could transform into does he turn into a cockroach-like bug?   How doe the rest of the characters respond to his transformation and  how does the fact that he is now a cockroach affect what he is fed and  his lifestyle?    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="fuchsia">
  <h3>QUEER THEORY: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How does the way Gregory's family treats him as an outcast after he becomes a vermin similar to the way family and friends react to someone after they coming out about being homosexual? <br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>There is a blend of gender roles in the context, form, and title of this work. How does Gregor show that he feel inadequate in his masculine role and through this metamorphosis seek to live as a woman?</li>
  </ul>

<h2><span class="class">Class 36 (Thesis exercise and Peer review of Term Paper) </span><span class="date">due Monday, November 12</span></h2>
      <p>The first part of class will be devoted to <em>The Thesis Exercise</em>. Read the <a href="222Thesis exercise.html">web page</a> about how to write a thesis for a literary paper. Print and fill out the <a href="222Theses.html">page of sample FL 222 theses</a> where you rate the examples. The second half of class will be devoted to peer review of the first draft of your <a href="222Paper2010.html">Paper</a>. Print out <strong>two copies</strong> of the <a href="Peerevaluation2.pdf">Peer Review Feedback Form</a> to include with the <strong>two copies</strong> of your draft which you will bring for your classmates. Fill out the top part of the form with your name, paper title, and date. Do <strong>not wait</strong> until the last minute to print these materials out. Email me before class if you have an idea for your own original topic so that I can approve it. Speaking of original, a very creative paper where almost all the main characters meet in Hell written by a former student is featured <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~dsbeckma/To Hell with Literature.htm"> here</a>, and my favorite missing chapter of <em>Candide</em> is <a href="222VoltaireCandide.html">here</a>. </p>
      <p>Selected writing advice from the <a href="222Paper2010.html">Term Paper page:</a></p>
      <h3>Choose your topic</h3>
      <p>Read through the topic choices below. Consult Chapter 10 in <span class="text"> A Short Guide, Writing about Fiction: the World of the Story</span>, especially the pages on &quot;Getting Ideas&quot; (171-5).  Which texts have been your favorite or challenged you the most? Send me an email or make an appointment if you need help deciding on a topic. If you are doing a creative project, you will not have a <strong>thesis </strong>per se in your rough draft, but you will replace that with a <strong>story premise </strong>that explains what the goal of your project is and how it relates to the text(s) you are responding to. </p>
      <h3>Steps for writing </h3>
      <p>Step 1: read, re-read and annotate your texts; write preliminary notes; build up to a fully formulated thesis. A thesis is a clear and specific argument, not a list, not an opinion, not an obvious fact.</p>
      <p>See the <a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/course/FL/222">Library Tools</a> page to see resources available to you from NCSU libraries. </p>
      <p>Step 2: Following <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>, Chapter 3; write a first draft of 1-2 pages about one of the topics below for the peer review session. It should have a working title and a fully formulated introduction (you can rewrite them later, but they need to be there for the draft) and several finished paragraphs; your audience knows the text, so you should avoid plot summaries. Use the present tense for literary analysis: Ivan <strong>is</strong> an ambitious&hellip; Flaubert <strong>reveals</strong>&hellip; Include your outline. This is the peer review draft version of your paper; print and bring 2 copies of it to class. Include the <a href="Peerevaluation2.pdf">Peer Review Feedback form</a> with each copy.</p>
      <p>Some useful pages (among many) about writing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> For the difference between formal and informal style: <a href="http://www.mondofacto.com/study-skills/writing/how-to-use-academic-writing-style/04.html">http://www.mondofacto.com/study-skills/writing/how-to-use-academic-writing-style/04.html</a>.</li>
        <li>For guidelines about  commas, see <a href="http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/commas.html">http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/commas.html</a></li>
        <li>For writing anxiety or writer's block, see <a href="http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/writing_anxiety.html">http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/writing_anxiety.html</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Dr. Beckman's hint about titles: A dull title sets expectations low. A good title invites the reader! Quotes, proverbs or aphorisms make great titles. Try a google search with a key word from your thesis (pride, satisfaction, quest, etc) and the word quote. I've already got a <a href="222Lovequotes.html">web page</a> with love quotes for you to use, since love is such a popular topic. </p>

<h2><span class="class">Class 39 (Paper Full Draft)</span><span class="date"> due Monday, November 19</span></h2>
<p>No class meeting, but  come to the classroom to drop off the complete draft of your paper along with your peer review drafts. See the <a href="222Paper2010.html">Paper</a> page for full details.</p>
<p>Highlights  include:</p>
<p>-Step 3: Reflect on your peer reviewers' suggestions and write a full draft of your paper to turn in to me. Proofread following the <span class="text">Editing</span> and other checklists listed on the inside cover of <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>. I will not grade the paper at this point but will return it to you with comments, so that you can write the final draft. If you are doing a creative project, be sure you have included both the creative section and the critical or artist's journal section. Consult the <a href="222scoringrubric.html">Scoring Rubric for Papers</a>, <a href="222scoringrubric-rewrite.html">Scoring Rubric for Creative Paper</a>, and <a href="222scoringrubriccreativeart.html">Scoring Rubric for Creative Art Projects</a> so that you'll know what I will be looking for when I do grade the paper.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Chapter 14 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> is an exellent presentation of the style and format I expect in  a literary paper. Pay attention to good organization and logical transitions between paragraphs.</li>
  <li>Base your arguments on close readings of the texts you have chosen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two areas that are normally weak in the first draft are the use of quotations and the conclusion.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Give concrete examples (quotes) from 
    the texts to support your arguments, but not to fill up space.  These quotations are the evidence you need to provide to prove your thesis. You will usually use at least one in each of body paragraphs.</li>
  <li>In order to integrate quotes appropriately, first introduce the quote by making the point, connected to your thesis, that the passage illustrates. Next, include the quote, usually 3-5 lines of text. Finally, tie the quote back into your argument with a concluding sentence in your own words: &quot;&hellip;remind your reader that these passages are there to prove a point. End your discussion on your words, not theirs.&quot; (Shannon, 162-3).</li>
</ul>
<p>A conclusion is very important to a fully developed paper. Go beyond the ideas in your introduction. Have you proved your thesis?  All readers, including your professor, will ask the question: &quot;So what?&quot; The conclusion should make the relevance and importance of your research clear.</p>
<p>You are not required to use secondary sources (books, articles, internet) for this paper, but if you do, be sure to quote and document them properly and attach a &#147;Works Cited&#148; page. <strong>Plagiarism is a poor choice and will not be tolerated</strong>; consult the <a href="222CIfa12.html">Course Information</a> page about the NC State academic integrity policy; ask me if questions remain. For information on using research (if you do) and writing the documentation page, consult <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>, chapter 17.</p>

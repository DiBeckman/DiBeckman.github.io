<p class="style1"><strong>The Importance of Being Earnest-1895<br>
  by Oscar Wilde</strong> (1854 -1900) <br>
  Wilde distinguished himself for his scholarship and wit, and also for his elegant eccentricity in dress, tastes, and manners. Influenced by the aesthetic teachings of Walter Pater and John Ruskin, Wilde became the center of a group glorifying beauty for itself alone, <a href="222Art4Art.html">&ldquo;art for art&rsquo;s sake&rdquo;. </a><br>

<p class="style1">Entertaining, witty, romantic, quotable, and sublimely ridiculous, comedies of manners simulataneously lampoom the mores of a particular upper-class culture while often embracing their targets. All forms of interaction are fair game for satiric farce and dazzling displays of language: the proper way in which to balance a teacup; the accuracy of a verbal dart; the satisfaction of the mot juste; the concentric circles of romantic flirtation, seduction and marriage. </p>

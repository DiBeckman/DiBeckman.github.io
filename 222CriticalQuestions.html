<p>From Edward Shannon's<span class="text"> The Prentice Hall Guide to Writing about Literature</span> (Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2002).</p>
<p>Four very basic questions to ask about a literary work (p. 27):</p>
<ul><li>What is confusing?</li>
<li>What is repeated?</li>
<li>What is familiar?</li>
<li>What is strange?</li></ul>
<p>Next, here is Shannon's list of critical questions related to different literary theories (pages 61-4) plus the final two written by my former student, Garry Pigg. You will need to adapt these questions for any individual text that you are studying. </p>
<h3>Questions to consider in <span class="maroon">Formalist </span>Criticism</h3>
<ol class="maroon"><li>How do various elements of the work (plot, character, point of view) create and reinforce its meanings?</li>
<li>How are the elements related to the whole?</li>
<li>What is the work's major organizing principle?</li>
<li>What issues are raised by the work? How does the work's structure resolve those issues?</li></ol>

<p>Another <a href="http://www.write.armstrong.edu/handouts/Formalism.pdf">source </a>for useful vocabulary for talking about the form of a literary work: </p>
<h3>Questions to consider in <span class="red"> Marxist </span> Criticism?</h3>
<ol class="red"><li> How are class differences presented in the work? Are the characters aware or unaware of the economic and social forces that affect their lives?</li>
<li> How do economic conditions determine the characters' lives?</li>
<li> What ideological values are explicit or implicit?</li>
<li> Does the work explicitly embrace or reject socialism?</li>
<li> Does the work criticize class structure?</li></ol>

<h3>Questions to consider in <span class="purple">Feminist</span> Criticism</h3>
<ol class="purple"><li> How are women's lives portrayed in the work? Do the women accept or reject these roles?</li>
<li> Are the form and content of the work influenced by the author's gender?</li>
<li>What are the relationships between men and women? Are these relationships sources of conflict? Do they provide resolution to conflicts?</li></ol>
<h3>Questions to Consider in <span class="teal">Cultural and Historical</span> Criticism</h3>
<ol class="teal"><li>  How does the work reflect the period in which it was created?</li>
<li> How does the work reflect the period it represents?</li>
<li>What literary or historical influences helped to shape the form and content of the work?</li>
<li>How important is the historical context (both the work and your own) to interpreting the work?</li></ol>

<h3>Questions to consider in <span class="orange">Psychological</span> Criticism</h3>
<ol class="orange"><li> How does the work reflect the author's personal psychology?</li>
<li> What do the character's emotions and behavior reveal about their
psychological states? What types of personalities are they?</li>
<li> Does the author present psychological matters such as repression, dreams, and desire, either consciously or unconsciously?</li></ol>
<h3>Questions to consider in <span class="blue">Reader Response</span> Criticism</h3>
<ol class="blue"><li>  How do you respond to the work?</li>
<li> How do your experiences and expectations affect your reading and interpretation?</li>
<li>Who is the work's intended audience? To what extent are you similar or dissimilar to that audience?</li></ol>

<h3>Questions to Consider in <span class="green">Ecological</span> Criticism </h3>
<ol class="green"><li>  How do the environmental/ecological conditions within the setting of the work affect the language, mood, tone, and theme?</li>
<li>How does the use of the word &quot;nature&quot; in the work reflect the current scientific beliefs of the time and how does that affect the characters, plot, themes?</li>
<li>How does the relationship between man/woman and his/her environment--economically, agriculturally, botanically, socially--affect the characters, language, theme, plot, and tone? i.e. do the characters have to hunt and gather, farm, trade, live in city, country?</li>
<li> How do plants, animals, and their conditions in the environment affect the character's livelihood, the plot, the author's tone, the moods, the theme? i.e. the effects of individual species such as cows, camels, horses,goats, bananas, sugar, cotton, corn, potatoes, fungi, bacteria, viruses; and ambient conditions such as drought, flooding, pollution, climate change, introduction of invasive species, and famine.</li></ol>
<h3>Questions to consider in <span class="fuchsia">Queer </span> Theory </h3>
<ol class="fuchsia"><li>  How do the cultural feelings about sex affect the characters, plot, and themes?</li>
<li> How does sexual identity affect the characters? How do they deal with others and their own sexual deviance or breaking of social norms?</li>
<li>How does homosexuality or bisexuality play a role in the characters' lives, the tone, mood, theme, and plot of the work?</li>
<li> What role does sexuality play in the work?  How does it affect the use of language? Does it represent love and beauty or marriage and reproduction?</li>
 <li> How does religion affect the tendencies of the characters to express or not express themselves sexually?</li>
<li> How does the work represent sex and sexuality?  Does it use sexuality to define &quot;others&quot;? Does discussion of sex in the work hinder or help feminism?  Does it hurt or help racism, discrimination in general, and civil rights?  What is the connection between sexuality, race, gender, and social class in the work(s)?</li></ol>

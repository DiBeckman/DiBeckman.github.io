<p>Excuse letters not to send me </p>
<p>Words to the wise:</p>
<p>Do not address your professor as &quot;hey.&quot;  <br />
Choosing the wrong clothes in the morning is not an excused absence.<br />
Wishing me a nice day does not earn you an excused absence.<br />

<p>Fall 2009:</p>
<p>Hi Prof. Beckman,</p>
<p>I had full intentions of coming to class today, but I just got out of<br />
  class in Tompkins and it is like a MONSOON outside, and when I left my<br />
  house this morning it was barely sprinkling so I didn't even think to<br />
  bring a rain jacket or umbrella. I just can't bring myself to walk all the<br />
  way across campus to Harrelson (in just a long sleeve t-shirt and fleece<br />
  vest) and be soaking wet and cold for the rest of the day. So if it lets<br />
  up soon then I will most definitely be on my way over there, but until<br />
  then I'm going to stay in here and reread Camus. Hope you have a nice day!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hey,<br />
  I know you are probably wondering why in the world I was not in class<br />
  today after emailing you about missing work.  I don't have a good excuse<br />
  except for the truth-I did not hear my alarm go off and woke up after<br />
class was over.</p>
<p>Now I know the syllabus says that today was the last day to turn in work.<br />
  I had a small stack of papers ready to turn in to you today, and I was<br />
  wondering if there was ANYTHING I could do-bring to your office hours on<br />
  Monday or to the exam review.  I know this may be a lot to ask, but I have<br />
  two revised compositions, a revised test, the missing homeworks (I found<br />
  the ones you emailed me about not having graded), and the review sheet-so<br />
  I know it would be very beneficial for me to have those turned in for my<br />
  grade.</p>
<p>I hope you believe me when I say I have really been trying to improve<br />
  lately and I am still very frustrated at myself for not being in class on<br />
  one of the most important days.  If there is any way I can give my work to<br />
  you, please let me know.  I'm really sorry and I hope you accept my<br />
  apology.</p>
<p>I hope you have a great weekend!</p>
<p>Truly sorry for not messaging you on this sooner. I was planned to take another exam today at&nbsp;<span data-term="goog_237886529" tabindex="0">8:00am</span>. I heard it was quick to finish, so I had planned to finish that one then attend yours. However, the exam started a bit later than I expected and I finished later than I expected. It was my fault for not planning around this; would there be a time that I could make-up your final exam? I understand if that will not be possible.</p>

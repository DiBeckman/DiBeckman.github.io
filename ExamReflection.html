  1) About the exam--Was it what you expected? Are you satisfied with your grade? Were you well prepared?<br />
  Will you do anything different to prepare next time?</p>
<p align="left">2) What would you like me to know about you as a student that will help us to have a successful semester?</p>
<p align="left">Please come see me in my office if you have any questions about the exam or your grade.</p>

<p class="style14"><b>COURSE DESCRIPTION</b><br />
  In this course we will explore the Western literary tradition through reading, 
  discussing, and writing about some of the major works of European literature 
  from the eighteenth through twentieth centuries. We will also pay attention 
  to the political and cultural contexts of these works. Students will &quot;engage the human experience through the interpretation of human culture [and] become aware of the act of interpretation itself as a critical form of knowing in the humanities.&quot; (<a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/uap/academic-standards/gep/courselists/humanities/requirement.html">General Education Program</a>, NCSU) <br />
  <br />
  <b>LEARNING GOALS</b><br />
  By the end of the course you should be able to: <br />
&#149; explain the characteristics of the major literary periods of Western 
  Culture from the Enlightenment to Modernism, comparing  &quot;ideas, values, images, cultural artifacts, economic structures, technological developments, [and] attitudes.&quot; (<a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/uap/academic-standards/gep/courselists/humanities/requirement.html">General Education Program</a>, NCSU) <br />
&#149; describe how a literary text reflects its historical context <br />
&#149; identify the literary and rhetorical devices employed in a text, such 
  as genre, point of view, irony, etc., and relate them to the content of the 
  text (See Course <a href="222Glossary.html">Glossary</a> or Glossary in Appendix B of <em>A Short Guide to Writing about Literature</em>) <br />
&#149; discuss, orally and in writing, selected literary texts of Western Culture 
  from the 18th century to the first half of the 20th century and their continuing 
  aesthetic validity or challenge <br />
&#149; write a coherent essay on given topics about these texts and their contexts, 
  supporting arguments with evidence (quotes) from the literary texts. The learning objective is for students to &quot;make academic arguments about the human experience using reasons and evidence for supporting those reasons that are appropriate to the humanities.&quot; (<a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/uap/academic-standards/gep/courselists/humanities/requirement.html">General Education Program</a>, NCSU). <br />
  <br />
  <b>GRADING<br />
  </b> Your grade in this course will be computed as follows: <br />
  <strong>Class Work</strong>: Attendance &amp; Participation (25%), Homework  (75%):<strong> <span class="style24">25%</span></strong><span class="style24"><br />
  <span class="style29">Poetry Presentation</span></span><span class="style29">:</span> <span class="style31">10%</span> <br />
  <strong>Discussion Board </strong>or<strong> Reading Notebook: </strong> <span class="style31">15%</span><br />
  <strong>Paper</strong>: <span class="style31">15%</span><br />
  <strong>Midterm</strong>: <span class="style31">15%</span><br />
  <strong>Final Exam</strong>: <span class="style31">20%</span><br />
  <br />
  There will be plus/minus grading in this class. The scale will be as follows:<br />
  A+ = 97.0-100, A = 93.0-96.9, A- = 90.0-92.9, <br />
  B+ = 87.0-89.9, B = 83.0-86.9, B- = 80.0-82.9, <br />
  C+ = 77.0-79.9, C = 73.0-76.9, C- = 70.0-72.9, <br />
  D+ = 67.0-69.9, D = 63.0-66.9, D- = 60.0-62.9, <br />
F = 59.9 and below.</p>
<p><span class="style25">Tips for success in this class:</span><span class="style14"><br />
From Student Evaluation Fall 2009: &quot;This class wasn't an easy A. I worked hard for every point. Tests were challenging and thorough. Assignments improved my overall writing abilities. Would recommend this class to someone who wants to get a wide range of experience to literature, but not someone who wants to breeze through the class without doing work.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="style14">This is a survey class with a lot of reading as well as daily writing assignments. I  expect a lot from  students and will do whatever I can to help you succeed. I recognize that this class meets a GEP requirement, and do <em>not </em>expect you to have have a background in the humanities. <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I will do my best to keep the class atmosphere creative, lively, and accepting 
  of your best efforts. Keep up with the work, participate actively in class, and you will improve and even master the material. Both <strong>effort</strong> and <strong>ability</strong> will be rewarded.</font><br />
  <br />
  <b>ATTENDANCE REGULATIONS</b><strong> &amp; LATE ASSIGNMENTS</strong>:<br />
  Attendance is <b>required</b> and will be taken 
  daily. You are expected to arrive on time to class. Repeated tardiness will 
  affect your grade: three tardies will count as one absence. You are permitted three absences with no penalty. Each additional 
  absence will reduce your class participation grade by one step (from A to A-, 
  from B+ to B, etc.). See me as soon as possible after an absence and provide 
  a written excuse to be accepted at my discretion (in case of illness, injury, 
  death or illness in the family, university duties, court attendance, or religious 
  observance). Save 
  your absences for emergencies. Excessive absences may lead to an F for the course. This 
policy is based upon the University Attendance Policy at <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/academic_affairs/pols_regs/REG205.00.4.php">http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/academic_affairs/pols_regs/REG205.00.4.php</a></p>
<p class="style14">If you need to miss a class, let me know 
  in person or by email before the class meeting, if possible.  Upon your return 
to class, you are responsible for all work missed and for any assignments announced during your absence.  <strong>No late work will receive full credit unless an excused absence has been accepted by the instructor.</strong></p>
<p class="style14"><strong>INCOMPLETE GRADES</strong><br />
  Incomplete grades will be given only when a student cannot complete the course work due to unforeseeable circumstances beyond his/her control and has done most of the course work. In the case of an excused absence, students need to set up a timetable with me to complete the missing assignments. <br />
  <br />
<b> CLASS WORK </b>(25% of final grade)<b>: </b></p>
<p class="style14"><strong>HOMEWORK<br />
</strong>Students prepare assigned reading (see <a href="222syfa10.html">Syllabus</a>) and writing  assignments<b> before</b> coming to class. The informal <span class="style5">daily</span> writing assignments  are posted  on the <a href="222writingassignmentsfa10.html">Daily Writing Assignment</a> page. They do not appear on the Syllabus. You may type or handwrite your daily writing assignment. <strong>Double space or skip lines</strong>, so there is room for my comments. Please include an assignment heading (for example, Pope <em>Essay on Man</em> Stanza X, Bovary 4) with your answer. You may also wish to copy and paste the prompt as a heading if you are typing the assignment. </p>
<p class="style14">  In your daily writing assignments, as on longer papers, be sure to cite your secondary sources. Not citing them can lead to a failing grade on the assignment or in the course. See the section on the <strong>Academic Integrity </strong> below. </p>
<p class="style14"><b>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY</b>: 
  The Foreign Language Department takes the University Policy on Academic Integrity 
  very seriously. An atmosphere of trust, honesty and respect for each other fosters 
  educational progress and success. Please do not give me any reason to be suspicious 
of your honesty. I ask each student  to fill out and return the <a href="AcademicIntegrityPledge.html">FL 222 Academic Integrity Form</a>. Please read it carefully before signing. </p>
<p class="style14"> You are expected to do your own work on all class assignments, papers, 
  and exams, unless it is a designated   group assignment. You must not incorporate others&#146; ideas or words and present them as your 
  own&#151;this is called plagiarism. Whether you take ideas (verbatim or just 
  as an idea) from books, the internet, or other sources does not matter; you 
  need to acknowledge their source if they are not your own. <span class="style19">Let me warn you especially 
    about the temptations of the internet</span><em>.</em>  There are appropriate and inappropriate uses of sites such as Wikipedia, sparknotes or shmoop in this class. <strong>Not citing your source is <span class="style19">always</span> inappropriate</strong>, and may result in a failing grade on the assignment or for the course.   Please ask me about 
  anything that remains unclear.<br />
   <br />
Violations of academic integrity (plagiarism, cheating, etc.) <strong>will be prosecuted</strong>  according to NC State&#146;s policy on academic integrity, posted at: <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/student_services/student_discipline/POL11.35.1.php">http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/student_services/student_discipline/POL11.35.1.php</a></p>
<p class="style14"><strong> PARTICIPATION</strong><br />
Cell phones must be turned off and mobile devices put away during class. </p>
<p class="style14">The attendance/ participation portion of the Class Work grade will be determined using the following criteria and attendance requirements above. You will also have the opportunity to fill out a self-evaluation form at midterm and at the end of the semester. </p>
<p class="style14">A = Student comes to class prepared, bringing proper materials, arriving on time and staying the full length of the class. Student is attentive and frequently volunteers to participate. Student is actively involved in all class activities and stays on task in group work. Any questions and comments are pertinent. <br />
  B = Student is are usually prepared. Student is attentive participates in all activities and volunteers from time to time. Student asks only pertinent questions. <br />
  C= Student shows evidence of being unprepared and may do homework, consult the newspaper, or text during class. Student may arrive late or leave early. Student volunteers infrequently and may ask questions that would not be necessary had the student prepared for class.<br />
  D = Student is unprepared and/or inattentive. Student rarely volunteers and demonstrates lack of involvement in class activities. Student may not stay on task in group work and may ask unnecessary or inappropriate questions. <br />
  F = Student is disrespectful and exhibits a lack of concern for the class. His or her behavior 
may have a negative effect on the class</p>
<p class="style14"><b>DISCUSSION BOARD</b>: 
Moodle Discussions<br />
To enhance your 
  involvement with our texts and extend class particpation outside of our limited 
  class time, you will be sharing observations and opinions on a class discussion 
  board. To access Moodle, go to <a href="http://moodle.wolfware.ncsu.edu">http://moodle.wolfware.ncsu.edu</a> 
  and log in with your Unity ID and password. Once logged in, you will be brought 
  to your <b>my Courses </b> page. Beneath the Courses header you will find links 
to the home pages of classes in which you are enrolled that are using Moodle. Click on FL 222. This will take you to the FL 222 home page. </p>
<p class="style14">If this is your  first visit to Moodle, you may wish to consult <em>Moodle Student Orientation </em>under <em>Learning with Moodle: A Student's Guide to Using  Moodle</em>. </p>
<p class="style14">On the FL 222 page, you will also find the Discussion Topics block where the various FL 222 discussion topics are listed. </p>
<p class="style14">For help with Moodle, follow the Help links or call 515-HELP.</p>
<p class="style14">In addition to 
  a first introductory post, you will be required to post at least 7 original 
  contributions (abbreviated as <b>oc </b>on the syllabus) on 7 different authors, each one at 
  least 7 lines long when it appears in Moodle.  You should make at least one good point and provide evidence for your 
  statement. This means that you should explain your interpretation or support it with a quote 
  from the text. You 
  can also make comparisons with other texts we have studied, make a comment on 
  a general theme (social rules and restrictions, utopia, boundaries), a specific 
  use of language, or invite discussion on a debatable point. In addition, you 
  are required to post 6 responses to contributions by others, on 6  
  different authors. Each response post must be at least 5 lines long.  Here, too, please support 
  your comment with evidence.  Before you post, please read what has already been written 
  to avoid duplication and a failing grade for that post. For your response, please 
  comment directly on what has been written by another student, mentioning him/her by name or quoting his/her post. It is fine to post an original contribution and response on the same author. </p>
<p class="style14">Dates by which 
  your introduction, 7 original contributions and 6 responses should be posted are listed on 
  the <a href="222syfa10.html">Syllabus</a>. Since there are more than 17 authors 
  you have flexibility; however, late postings will <b>not </b>count towards your 
  grade. Cutoff is midnight when the date changes. You are responsible for a total of <strong>14 posts</strong>, including your self-introductory post to the class.</p>
<p class="style14">Discussion Board 
  postings will be graded pass/fail. If you submit 14 acceptable posts, you'll get full credit: 15% of your final grade. If your first post is  unacceptable, I will let you know by email, and you'll have another chance. In order 
  not to get behind on your postings, I recommend that you make at least 3 original 
  contributions and 3 responses by midterm. You may post as often as you like 
  to contribute to the discussion, as long as you remain on topic.</p>
<p class="style14"><b>READING NOTEBOOK</b><br />
  As an alternative to the Discussion Board <span class="style19">or for extra credit <span class="style5">(see below)</span></span>, you may choose 
  to keep a Reading Notebook which will be turned in 4 times over the semester as indicated on the <a href="222syfa10.html">Syllabus</a>. 
  <br />
  Notebook check 1: Wednesday, Sept. 8,  2010 <br />
  Notebook check 2: Wednesday, Oct. 6, 2010 <br />
  Notebook check 3: Wednesday, Nov. 10, 2010 <br />
  Notebook check 4: Final exam<br />
  <br />
Please use a  soft-cover ring binder with tab dividers, or loose leaf or hole-punched paper with a notebook ring to keep it together. You can organize your notebook your own way as long as you include the information listed below. For example, some students prefer to organize their notebooks chronologically, with <em>Just the</em> <em>Facts</em>, <em>Vocubulary</em> and <em>Lightning</em> for each text all together. Others prefer to keep each section separate. </p>
<p class="style14">You will be graded on completeness, thoughtfulness, 
  and creativity: see <a href="222Gradingreadingnotebook.html">Notebook Grading 
Rubric</a>. Print out a copy of the <a href="222Gradingreadingnotebook.html">rubric</a> to put at the front of your notebook. Sign  the <span class="style24">Academic Integrity Pledge</span> on the rubric each time you turn in the notebook.</p>
<p class="style14"> Section 1: <b>Just the Facts</b>. One page for each work we study. Include title, 
  date, author, original language (this information will be tested on the midterm and final), a list of the main characters and the setting of the work, and a one-to-three paragraph 
  plot summary. These pages will be extremely helpful when you study for exams. Some students like to do a <a href="http://www.google.com/imghp?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;tab=wi">Google Images</a> search for the author, text cover, or related illustration and include the image on the <em>Just the Facts</em> page. Include the URL for your images as well. <br />
  <br />
  Section 2: <b>Vocabulary</b>. List of new or unfamiliar words you encounter 
  while reading or hear in class, including literary terms, along with their definitions. One  great idea from previous semesters:   type a sentence (from the text or of your own invention) with the unfamiliar word in <strong>bold</strong>. This will help you build your vocabulary. Use an online or paper dictionary to look up words you don't know<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. </font>See  <em>A Short Guide's</em> Glossary of Literary Terms, pp. 345-358 as well. You should 
  have entries for each text we read. As always, cite your sources. If you use the same source each time, you only need to cite it once. <br />
  <br />
  Section 3: <b>Lightning</b>: what struck you while you were reading? <br />
  Copy down memorable or provocative passages or images; include 
  your personal response to something you&#146;ve read. What did it make you think 
of in your own life? How does it help you understand the author or the story better or your own life better? </p>
<p class="style14">Shannon&#146;s 4 questions  are also helpful guides:<br />
  What is confusing?<br />
  What is repeated?<br />
  What is familiar?<br />
  What is strange?<br />
  <br />
  Here is an example of lightning from a student's homework: &quot;However a strange phrase 
  with which I was not familiar was the image of <span class="style21">a rose dying in aromatic pain</span>. To say this expression took my breath away would be clich&eacute;, but it just about did. The way Alexander Pope wrote this phrase made me feel as if I had been shocked by an electric current. The rose, while doing its job, shows no sign of anguish whatsoever. This flower presents itself in a content fashion, not questioning its way of life. It may suggest to us humans to follow its example and go along with the positions to which God has designated us.&quot;  As a teacher, I appreciated this comment because the student showed a strong reaction to the text <strong>and </strong>connected her insight back to the author and his purpose. <br />
  <br />
  Another idea is to use the web to search for quotes by a particular author and find one that sparks some thoughts in your mind. I typically use Google and type in the author's name and the word quotations. Be sure to show how this quote relates to the text we have read for class. <br />
  <br />
  Section 4: Optional. Class reflections, notes, written work and tests returned, 
etc.</p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style24"><span class="style5">On the grading rubric, you'll notice:</span> <em>After the first submission, response to instructor feedback is 
  included.</em> <span class="style5">This means that I expect you to write responses to at least  some of the comments I write on your notebook pages or homework. The Reading Notebook, like the daily writing assignments, is ideally a dialogue between teacher and student. </span></span><br />
  <br />
  <b>EXAMS</b>: There will be a midterm (15% of final grade) and a final exam (20% of final grade) as indicated on the <a href="222syfa10.html">Syllabus</a>. Make-up for exams will be granted 
  only if you are excused <b>in advance</b> with proper documentation. There may be  a pop-quiz and extra-credit weekly vocabulary quizzes during the semester. <br />
  <br />
  Exams will consist of:<br />
  1) <strong>Identification</strong> of selected passages. Identify the <font color="#FF0000">author, work, approximate 
    date, and original language</font>. Briefly discuss the passage and 
  its relevance  to the work as a whole with attention to both form and content. <br />
  2) <strong>Short essay</strong> (approx. 300 words) on the <font color="#FF0000">literary movements</font> studied. You will be expected to define and illustrated the movement(s) by referring to authors, works, main ideas, relevant literary terms (satire, autobiography, absurd) and any appropriate social or historical events. Include two examples from non-literary cultural artifacts such as music of the era (heard in class or on your own) or art works from our textbook or the <a href="http://www.ncartmuseum.org/">North Carolina Museum of Art</a>. <br />
  3) <strong>Long essay</strong> (400-500 words) on a given topic or theme and how it is treated in at least 
  two works we have studied. <br />
  <br />
  <b>POETRY PROJECT AND PAPERS</b><br />
  In addition to the <a href="222writingassignmentssp10.html">informal writing assignments</a>, you will present and submit a <a href="222poetrypresentation.html">Poetry Project</a> (10% of final grade) as well as  a <a href="222Paper2010.html">Term Paper</a> (15% of final grade). The poetry project should be 3-4 pages long, the paper  5-8 pages. Due 
dates are listed on the <a href="222sysp10.html">Syllabus</a>. </p>
<p class="style14">Papers are due at the beginning of the class period. Email submissions and late 
  submissions will only be accepted with my permission, and must be arranged before the due date of the paper. <br />
  <br />
See <a href="222writingassessment.html">Writing Assessment for Short Assignments</a> (for the poetry paper) and the <a href="222scoringrubric.html">Scoring Rubric</a> (for the term paper) to see how your papers
  will be graded and what to strive for in the areas of content, organization 
and format, grammar, vocabulary and fluency, and supporting documents. </p>
<p class="style14">We will work with <em>A Short Guide to Writing About Literature</em> to support your writing about 
      literature. You do not need to consult critical literature on the author or 
      the text, but should engage yourself closely with the text, or an aspect of 
      it, and formulate your thoughts about it in a organized way. I am most interested 
      in your own original ideas, not someone else&#146;s, nor  a paraphrase of 
my comments from class, our class discussions, or the readings themselves. </p>
<p class="style14">However, if you want to learn more about a particular author or work, particularly for the longer writing assignments, consult the <em>Selected Bibliographies</em> in the back of our textbook (pages 2537-2556.) I have also put some articles on <a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/reserves/">e-reserve</a> and on the <a href="222supmatf04.html">Supplementary Materials</a> and Lecture Notes pages. If you find an especially good article that you think I should include online, please let me know. Another good source for short articles is the Norton Critical Edition of a particular text. These are  available at DH Hill Library. <span class="MsoNormal"></span></p>
<p class="style14">For the format 
  of footnotes and bibliography,  refer to Chapter 15 in <em>A Short Guide</em> or the MLA Style Manual 
  (available in bookstore or library). You can also use the NCSU Libraries' <a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/lobo2/citationbuilder/citationbuilder.php">Citation Builder</a>.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Supporting documents</strong>: We will use a peer review process as well as instructor review to help you improve 
  your writing. See the <a href="PeerReviewFeedback.html">Peer Review Feedback</a> form. Print out and bring two copies of this form for your classmates to fill out for you. You will also fill out a Self-Evaluation/Reflection  to include along with the Peer Review Feedback forms and first drafts when you turn in your final

<p class="style14"><span class="style14"><strong>MUSEUM VISIT</strong>: You are also required to visit the <a href="http://www.ncartmuseum.org/">North Carolina Museum of Art</a> here in Raleigh and write me a 2-3 page paper about your visit. Please choose at least two works of art  to focus on, and share your impressions of the museum overall. This paper, which has the same weight as 3 homework assignments, may be turned in anytime during the semester, but must be turned in by Thanksgiving break. As part of the midterm and final oral exams, you will be reponsible including two examples of  non-literary art works (such as painting, sculpture or music) from  the periods we are studying. I encourage you to choose at least one from the NCMA collection.  Details are included on the <a href="222ArtMuseumVisit.html">NCMA-222 Assignment page</a>. You may visit the museum on your own or at one of the daily guided tours at 1:30 pm. I will also organize two optional group tours for our class, one for the Enlightment-Realist periods (Friday, Sept. 17; 7-8:30 pm) and one for Modernism (Friday, November 5; 7-8:30 pm). Each visit is limited to 15 students. Please email me to sign up. You will receive extra credit for attending.</span></p>
<p class="style14"><b>EXTRA CREDIT and HONORS CREDIT <br />
</b>To earn up to 4 points extra credit on your final grade, you may maintain and submit a Reading Notebook (see 
above) in addition to participating in the online discussions. <br />
<br />
<span class="style15"><span class="style5">You can also earn 
extra credit towards your Class Work grade by doing the </span> <a href="Type/ExtraCreditType.html">Extra Credit Assignment on <em>Myers-Briggs Type in College</em></a></span>. This would be a good thing to do the first month of class, so that you and I can get to know one another better. </p>
<p class="style14">In addition, you can  attend supplementary art or literary activities which relate 
  to our class. To get extra credit, write me something about what you learned or something which impressed you. 
  You may also consider using a play or particular art work in your papers. There are several plays performed locally this semester that I have listed on the <a href="222syfa10.html">Syllabus</a> for extra credit. To write about drama, see <em>A</em> <em>Review of a Dramatic Production </em>(pages 73-77) and Chapter 11 in <em>A Short Guide</em>. See me with any questions. </p>
<p class="style14">Students have also approached me about getting honor credit for the class. I am happy to work with you to design a project that will meet those requirements. </p>
<p class="style22"><span class="style9"><strong>COURSE EVALUATIONS: </strong>Online class evaluations will be available for students to complete during the last two weeks of class.

<p class="style14"><b>STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES</b>: For all students currently registered with 
    the  Disability Services for Students (DSO), an accommodation letter 
    will be sent to the instructor. This letter verifies that appropriate documentation 
    is on file and that the student has a substantiated disability requiring effective 
    reasonable accommodations. Any student requesting accommodations for whom a 
    letter has not been written must see a DSO service provider in Suite 1900, Student 
    Health Center.<br />
    <br />
Students with disabilities, for whom a letter of accommodation has been sent 
  from the DSO office to the instructor, should schedule an appointment with the 
  instructor immediately. <br />

DIVERSITY POLICY:</strong> <br />
This course fosters free and open dialogue, the acceptance and discussion of different opinions, and mutual respect among class members. Since class participation is required, it is important that students are not afraid to speak up and share their ideas. Please consult <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/campus_environ/non-discrimination/REG04.25.1.php">NCSU Policies on Non-Discrimination</a> . </p>
<p class="style14">Every member of the university community has the right to work and learn in an environment free from discrimination and harassment. Since everyone has this right, everyone also has the responsibility to help prevent discrimination or harassment from occurring. There are some simple ways to prevent discrimination and harassment. One of the most important ways is to respect others and make sure your actions serve as a role model for others. You can also:<br />
  &bull;	Get to know those around you.<br />
  &bull;	Do not talk about topics such as sex, race, ethnicity, or religion on the job or in the classroom unless it is germane to the discussion.<br />
  &bull;	Refrain from using jokes, words, and gestures with sexual, racial, religious, or other discriminatory connotations.<br />
  &bull;	Respect others' personal space.<br />
  &bull;	Avoid making assumptions about others.<br />
  &bull;	As members of a university community, we all have the right to work and learn without being discriminated against or harassed. We also have some responsibilities &mdash; to help prevent discrimination and harassment, and to help address it when it does occur.</p>

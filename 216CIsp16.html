<h2>COURSE DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p><em>France: Art and Society</em>&nbsp;is a new 3-credit Spring Semester Course which meets on campus through the semester and also includes a week (Spring Break) spent in Paris, France. This class will introduce students to the history of French Art as well as the French language (a major influence on English). By looking at the role Paris played and still plays on the world stage and focusing on themes of diversity and power, we will investigate how studying another country's art and society will help us to better understand our own.  </p>
<p dir="ltr">&quot;If you really want to see something, look at something else.&quot; &mdash;Howard Nemerov. To understand European and American history, understanding Paris is essential. This class will compare the French and American cultures though the visual and performing arts,  introduce students to the French language (a major influence on English), and give them the opportunity to examine in writing their own &quot;in-group&quot; and social identity. By selecting and then speaking and writing about four Images of Power, students will &quot;engage the human experience through the interpretation of human culture [and] become aware of the act of interpretation itself as a critical form of knowing in the humanities.&quot; (<a href="http://oucc.ncsu.edu/gep-hum">General Education Program</a>, NCSU) This course meets GEP Visual and Performing Arts and Global Knowledge requirements as FL 216 and meets the GEP Visual and Performing Arts and US Diversity requirements as VPUS 295.<br />
  <br />
There are no prerequisites for the course. The language of instruction is English. If you are interested in becoming proficient in French, you might sign up for FLF 101 or FLF 110 as well. There will be intensive French tourist language instruction as part of on-campus, pre-departure classes. Students proficient in French will be able to submit the final paper in French.
</p>
<h2>Student Learning Outcomes</strong><br />
</h2>
<p><strong><em>Visual &amp; Performing Arts </em></strong></p>
<p>At the end of the course students will be able to:
<ul><li>Describe the aesthetic, historical, and cultural evolution of the arts in France.
<li>Analyze works of French of art to demonstrate how the general social and historical background is embedded in the artistic details of the chosen work of art and how artistic elements (composition, color, line, space, shapes, etc.) are used to create content and meaning.
<li>Explain how French art relates to the cultural and historical contexts in the country of France.</ul>
 
 <strong><em>Global Knowledge</em></strong>
<p>At the end of the course students will be able to:
<ul><li>Identify and examine works of art, cultural artifacts, ideas, values, technological developments, and attitudes of France from the country's origins to the present.
<li>Explain how French art relates to its cultural and historical contexts in the country of France.</ul>
<p><strong><em>Diversity</em></strong> </p>
<ul><li>Identify, research, and discuss in writing a specific sociological &quot;in-group&quot; reflecting the American experience of religious, gender, ethnic, racial, class, sexual orientation, disability, and/or age identities as shaped by our cultural and societal influences.
<li>Evaluate and interpret   evidence of  difference and culture, identity and community, privilege and oppression, and power and responsibility in student-selected images (fine arts or popular culture) from the United States and France.
</ul>
<h2>GRADING</h2>
<p>Your grade in this course will be computed as follows: <br />
  <strong>Class Work</strong>: Attendance &amp; Participation:<strong> <span class="red">10%</span></strong><br />
  <strong><a href="216Travel Journal.html">Travel Journal</a> <span class="red">15%</span></strong> <br />
  <strong> Portfolio/Moodle posts</strong><strong>:  <span class="red">15%</span></strong><br />
  <strong>Autoethnography: <span class="red">20%</span></strong><br />
  <strong>Final Research Project: &quot;Images of Power&quot;: <span class="red">40% </span></strong><span class="red">(20% presentation, 20% paper)</span></p>
<p>Your final grade will be calculated using <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/document/d/1pMOnGov9FmPIS8gdGYukzmgfoLTWXUoYWPRe0BnbI-I/edit?usp=sharing">this form</a>.<br />
</p>
<p>There will be plus/minus grading in this class. The scale will be as follows:<br />
  A+ = 97.0-100, A = 93.0-96.9, A- = 90.0-92.9, <br />
  B+ = 87.0-89.9, B = 83.0-86.9, B- = 80.0-82.9, <br />
  C+ = 77.0-79.9, C = 73.0-76.9, C- = 70.0-72.9, <br />
  D+ = 67.0-69.9, D = 63.0-66.9, D- = 60.0-62.9, <br />
F = 59.9 and below.</p>
<h2>ATTENDANCE REGULATIONS &amp; LATE ASSIGNMENTS</h2>
<p>Attendance is <strong>required</strong> and will be taken daily. You are expected to arrive on time to class. Repeated tardiness will 
  affect your grade: three tardies will count as one absence. You are permitted two absences with no penalty. Each additional 
  absence will reduce your class participation grade by one step (from A to A-, 
  from B+ to B, etc.). See me as soon as possible after an absence and provide 
  a written excuse to be accepted at my discretion (in case of illness, injury, 
  death or illness in the family, university duties, court attendance, or religious 
  observance). Save 
  your absences for emergencies. <strong>Excessive absences may lead to an F for the course</strong>. </p>
<p>If you need to miss a class, let me know 
  in person or by email before the class meeting, if possible.  Upon your return 
to class, you are responsible for all work missed and for any assignments announced during your absence. If you ask me if you missed anything, <a href="DidIMissAnything.html">here</a> is the reply I will be tempted to send you. <strong>No late work will receive full credit unless an excused absence has been accepted by the instructor</strong>. These policies are based on Departmental and <a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03">University Attendance Regulations</a>.</p>
<h2>INCOMPLETE GRADES</h2>
<p>Incomplete grades will be given only when a student cannot complete the course work due to unforeseeable circumstances beyond his/her control and has done most of the course work. In the case of an excused absence, students need to set up a timetable with me to complete the missing assignments. </p>
<h2>HOMEWORK</h2>
<p>Students prepare assigned reading and exercises as indicated on <a href="216sp16sy.html">Syllabus</a>. In all  writing assignments be sure to cite your secondary sources. Not citing them can lead to a failing grade on the assignment or in the course. See the section on the <strong>Academic Integrity </strong> below. </p>
<h2>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY</h2> 
<p>The Foreign Language Department takes the University Policy on Academic Integrity 
  very seriously. An atmosphere of trust, honesty and respect  fosters 
  educational progress and success. Please do not give me any reason to be suspicious 
of your honesty. </p>
<p> You are expected to do your own work on all class assignments, papers, 
  and exams, unless it is a designated group assignment. You must not incorporate others&#146; ideas or words and present them as your 
  own&#151;this is called plagiarism. Whether you take ideas (verbatim or just 
  as an idea) from books, the internet, or other sources does not matter; you 
  need to acknowledge their source if they are not your own. <strong>Let me warn you especially 
    about the temptations of the internet</strong>. There are appropriate and inappropriate uses of sites such as Wikipedia in this class. Not citing your source is <strong class="red">always</strong> inappropriate, and may result in a failing grade on the assignment or for the course.</p>
 
<p>Violations of academic integrity (plagiarism, cheating, etc.) <strong>will be prosecuted</strong>  according to <a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01">NCSU Code of Student Conduct</a>. <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/student_services/student_discipline/POL11.35.1.php"></a></p>
<h2>PARTICIPATION</h2>
<p>Phones must be silent and put away during class. No texting, please. Violations will affect your participation grade.</p>
<p>The attendance/ participation portion of the Participation grade will be determined using the following criteria and attendance requirements above. You will also have the opportunity to fill out a self-evaluation of your participation in class. </p>
<p>A = Student comes to class prepared, brings proper materials, and arrives on time. Student is attentive and frequently volunteers to participate. Student is actively involved in all class activities and stays on task in group work. Any questions and comments are pertinent. <br />
  B = Student is  usually prepared. Student is attentive, participates in all activities, and volunteers from time to time. Student asks only pertinent questions. <br />
  C= Student shows evidence of being unprepared and may do homework, consult the newspaper, or text during class. Student may arrive late or leave early. Student volunteers infrequently and may ask questions that would not be necessary had the student prepared for class.<br />
  D = Student is unprepared and/or inattentive. Student rarely volunteers and demonstrates lack of involvement in class activities. Student may not stay on task in group work and may ask unnecessary or inappropriate questions. <br />
  F = Student is disrespectful and exhibits a lack of concern for the class. His or her behavior 
may have a negative effect on the class</p>
<h2> Portfolio</h2>
<p>Each student will create a Class Portfolio as a shared Google Docs folder (Please title the folder with your name and FL 216 and share with all three instructors. If you prefer to do an non-virtual portfolio, that can be arranged.) Some of the documents to include in the Portfolio are:<ul><li> Notes for your arrondissement and painting presentations
<li> Entries about required reading and film viewing: you may print out your posts, or take this opportunity to revise them to improve the spelling/grammar and reflect on what your learned during our time in Paris. You should also include comments on the required texts as well as the books and films you posted about. 
<li> Comments on the four paintings you studied before and during our trip
<li> Notes on what you did to learn French
<li> Notes and questions relating to your ethnography and final paper
<li> Anything else you find appropriate</ul>

  <span class="date">March 24:</span> First draft due/peer review of Autoenthography<br />
  <span class="date">April 7:</span> Final draft due </p>
<p>You belong to many different kinds of social groups, both voluntarily and involuntarily. These groups help you to understand and define who you are, who you are becoming, and what your unique role in our society is. For this course, you will write an autoethnography as a way for you to explore, analyze, and explain how one of the groups that you belong to has affected your sense of who you are or who you are becoming. Autoethnography is a genre of writing that explores the researcher's personal experience and connects this autobiographical story to wider cultural, political, and social meanings and understandings through qualitative research.</p>
<p>In this autoethnography, you will explore your position within your in-group, broaden your audience's understanding of the group, and address challenges that you and your group may face. Though this assignment is very personal and reflective in nature, you will need to do more than simply tell your audience about yourself and your in-group. An autoethnography is not just a personal narrative or story; thus, you will need to use your collected research in order to help you analyze the social movements and relationships of your group with some degree of depth.</p>
<p>Please turn in <strong>one</strong> <strong>hard copy</strong> of the Autoenthnograpy on April 7,  along with the Peer Reviews and Peer review drafts. At the same time, please share the project via Google Docs or Word attachment to Professors Auten, Beckman, and Marchi.</p>
<h2>FINAL PROJECT: IMAGES OF POWER</h2>
<p><span class="date">March 31:</span> Peer review of Final Project<br />
  <span class="date">April 12-21:</span> Class presentations <br />
  <span class="date">April 26:</span> Final Class Project due </p>
<p>For your final project, you will  select four powerful images, two from the US and two from France, that  illustrate one of the Diversity Categories: difference and culture, identity and community, priviledge and oppression, or power and responsibility. You may choose art works or personal or professional photographs. The images may relate to your autoethnography or may focus on another topic of interest to you.<br />
  <br />
  After selecting your images you will describe, evaluate, and interpret these images individually and then discuss how the works &quot;speak&quot; to each other as a group. To prepare your interpretation, you will also research the historical and social context of the images, following the approach in <em>How to Read World History in Art</em>. Examine and explain both how the images themselves are powerful and how power is represented in them. Where possible, you will also research the life and ideas of the artist. On <span class="date">March 31</span>, a peer review draft of the final project is due. To share the results of your investigation, you will give a 10-15 minute presentation &nbsp;to the class during the last two weeks of class. The class presentation should  be an engaging experience for the audience. Please share your observations and invite their comments and questions. The presentation will be peer-graded using <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/document/d/1pWOW2REFi4XLx_aRu6hhc8HRADlZZi6SkDMWJ2KGhOo/edit?usp=sharing">this rubric</a>.</p>
<p>You will also write an 8-10 page paper on your <strong>Images of Power</strong> as your final class project due by noon on <span class="date">April 26</span> at the Main FLL Office, WI 310. The written paper should reflect your research and what you learned from presenting in class; an informed interpretation of your chosen images. Please turn in <strong>one</strong> <strong>hard copy</strong>  along with the Peer Reviews and Peer review drafts. At the same time, please share the project via Google Docs or Word attachment to Professors Auten, Beckman, and Marchi. The project will be graded using <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/document/d/14JBEke5JAjGFX4olz_MvHfnp48LUeOqHKX_UPgvkQaU/edit?usp=sharing">this rubric</a>.

It will be returned to you in a final individual meetings in the classroom during our scheduled final exam time, Tuesday May 3 between 9-11 am.</p>
<p>Your final grade will be calculated using <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/document/d/1pMOnGov9FmPIS8gdGYukzmgfoLTWXUoYWPRe0BnbI-I/edit?usp=sharing">this form</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>CLASS DISCUSSIONS</strong> POLICY</h2>
<p>We will have open and honest discussions of race and culture, including interracial or intercultural interactions, misunderstandings and confusions. To make our discussion authentic, we will not attack each other. And we will pledge not to take anyone&rsquo;s name outside of this classroom. Leave here and talk about what was said, so that you can understand it better. But leave the classroom with no person&rsquo;s name (except the professors') on your lips. In other words, who says what in here, stays in here.</p>
<h2>DIVERSITY POLICY</h2>
<p>This course fosters free and open dialogue, the acceptance and discussion of different opinions, and mutual respect among class members.  Since class participation is required, it is important that students not be afraid to speak up and share their ideas. If you ever feel that you have been intimidated or treated disrespectfully in class, by me or by another student, please come see me in private as soon as possible. That is not the environment I desire for this class. </p>
<p>Every member of the university community has the right to work and learn in an environment free from discrimination and harassment. Since everyone has this right, everyone also has the responsibility to help prevent discrimination or harassment from occurring. One of the most important ways is to respect others and make sure your actions serve as a role model for others. You can also:</p><ul>
<li>Get to know those around you.</li>
<li>Our literary texts discuss sensitive topics such as sex, race, ethnicity, and religion. Your observations on these topics should relate to the works we are studying and your responses to them. If the one of these topics triggers an intense personal reaction, don't hesitate to come speak to me or a University counselor privately about it. </li>
<li>Refrain from using jokes, words, and gestures with sexual, racial, religious, or other discriminatory connotations.</li>
<li>Respect others' personal space. </li>
<li>Avoid making assumptions about others. Ask for their opinions and insights.</li>
<li>As members of a university community, we all have the right to work and learn without being discriminated against or harassed. We also have some responsibilities &mdash; to help prevent discrimination and harassment, and to help address it when it does occur.</li></ul>

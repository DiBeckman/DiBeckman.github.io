<p align="center">The Dead Part 2</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gabriel awoke the next morning to a subtle touch on his leg. Rolling over to investigate, he realized that there was hand placed on his leg, that was not Gretta&rsquo;s! Startled by this notion, he sat up with great haste, but soon realized it was in fact his own hand. He had been unable to decipher the difference as his arm was completely numb. He had slept on his shoulder and lost feeling in his right arm. Gretta, startled by this commotion, began to stir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong Gabriel?&rdquo; She asked</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh nothing, I slept on my arm and it startled me&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gabriel, rising from the bed, walked towards the window and stood there motionless. His arm had begun to tingle as it regained feeling. The snow was falling ever so slowly and had accumulated at the base of the window. His mind began to wander as he watched the children throw snowballs at each other in the street.</p>
<p>As his mind wandered he couldn&rsquo;t help but think about Michael Furey and the conversation he had had the night before with his wife. The name Michael Furey would forever haunt his mind. It was as if Gretta believed him to be a martyr to love. Gabriel felt sick to his stomach from these thoughts and turned away from the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why have you never told me about Michael Furey?&rdquo; Gabriel asked, walking towards the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was so long ago I really don&rsquo;t like to talk about it&rdquo; she said</p>
<p>Gabriel said nothing; it was hard for him to believe that his plans for a romantic evening had been utterly destroyed by the memory of rival. I must do something to make her forget about him, he thought to himself. I can&rsquo;t let the memory of Michael Furey overshadow our marriage. He could tell she was still thinking about her dead lover by the way she stared blankly towards the couch. The awkward silence was broken by the call of the porter; it was now 8 o-clock.&nbsp; They began to gather their belongings and preparing for their trip home. Gabriel went down to the front desk to check out and pay their bill while Gretta waited patiently in the hotel room. When Gabriel returned Gretta was stretched out on the bed with her arm across her body and her hand placed on her forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like it if I skipped my cycling trip this year and went on vacation? You told me yesterday you wished to visit Galway, or we could even go home to Connacht. How would you like that Gretta?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said nothing; her thoughts were elsewhere, noticing this Gabriel began to become frustrated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; she said, rising to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh nothing&rdquo; he said in dismay</p>
<p>&ldquo;No really, what was it you said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was suggesting that we go on vacation to Galway, possibly Aran Isle&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really Gabriel!&rdquo; she said with an excitement that lifted Gabriel&rsquo;s heart. He had not seen her smile since his speech at the dinner table. </p>
<p>&ldquo;If it would make you happy, I will take you this summer&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would love it if we could walk along Corrib1, it is so beautiful when the sun sets&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can have dinner and walk along the promenade&rdquo; said Gabriel</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A look of satisfaction filled Gabriel&rsquo;s face. He had successfully directed Gretta&rsquo;s thoughts away from Michael Furey and towards their future together. It brought a flicker of hope back into their relationship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go fetch a cab&rdquo; said Gabriel</p>
<p>They left at once and for the time being everything seemed agreeable. The more they discussed their vacation, the happier Gretta was. She had not been to Galway since she was a child. She stayed many summers there with her Aunt and Uncle who worked at a prestigious fish market known for their porbeagle2. She told stories of how she would watch the fisherman throw the days dying bait over the peer, waiting for the sharks to appear from the midst of the dark water. Gretta would spend her summers making geansa&iacute;3, which would be sold at her Uncle&rsquo;s market. Fisherman traveled from all over Galway to purchase her renowned work.</p>
<p>As they approached home they began to discuss what they would do for dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lets go to Brandubh&rsquo;s for dinner, what do you say?&rdquo; said Gabriel</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Gabriel, you know how expensive that is? I thought we were going on vacation. We&rsquo;ll never be able to afford all this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sparked by romance, Gabriel had no worries about money. His only wish was to make the love of his happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know they always have live music on Fridays&rdquo; she said</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes you see there&rdquo; Gabriel said to the cab driver, pointing towards Brandubh&rsquo;s</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the crowd of people sir&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rdquo; Yes drop us off there, that will be fine&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brandubh&rsquo;s was walking distance from their house and he insisted they be dropped off immediately. Gabriel paid the driver and worked his way through the crowd to make reservations. To his and Gretta&rsquo;s delight the crowd was leaving, it had apparently been someone&rsquo;s birthday. Gabriel could hardly tell her the good news because all they could hear was. </p>
<p><em>&ldquo;When the wedding bells are ringing his the breat to lead the singing<br>
  then in jigs the folks go swinging what a splendid piper<br>
  He will blow from eve to morn counting sleep a thing with scorn<br>
  old is he but not outworn know ye such a piper&rdquo; </em>4 </p>
<p>The gentleman whose birthday it was stumbled and fell in the snow, laughing at himself for being so screwed5. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see that fellow? He needs to go home before he catches pneumonia&rdquo; said Gretta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I did, they&rsquo;re calling for us now&rdquo;</p>
<p>Escaping the cold they found their way to their table, which to Gretta&rsquo;s delight was a short distance away from the piano. There was an old man dressed in an all white tuxedo, heading towards the piano. He had white hair with a white curly mustache that ever so slightly covered the scar on his right cheek.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;My name is McNeil, can I get you some crubeens6 or porter7?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No thank you, we&rsquo;d like a bottle of your finest wine&rdquo; said Gabriel</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Most certainly sir&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you thinking Gabriel? That could cost more then our meal!&rdquo; Gretta said</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lets live a little; we never do anything spontaneous&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a simple nod she had to agree. Their daily life had become so dull and passionless, she too, was living in the moment. The candlelight set the mood and the pianist began to play. The candlelight flickered in their faces as they talked of their vacation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it our second honeymoon&rdquo; he said leaning across the table to give her a kiss. Her eyes fluttered with the innocence of a young girl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you know what you&rsquo;d like to eat sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get the <a name="lambroast">Uaineoil Faoi Chrusta</a>8&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Gabriel could finish his sentence the piano strings hit a harmony that unnerved his soul. Wide eyed and in disbelief, Gabriel turned, the pianist was playing &ldquo;The Lass of Aughrim.&rdquo; Gretta sat with her hands in her face looking towards the table. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Ill give you &pound;5 to stop playing that dreadful song&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sir, that man over there gave me &pound;5 to play it&rdquo; said the pianist.</p>
<p>At that moment Gabriel came to the realization that he would never be able to escape the taunting memories of Michael Furey. Gabriel felt as if his heart had just dissolved, leaving him empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you &pound;10!&rdquo; Gabriel yelled over the pianist&rsquo;s lyrics</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&rdquo; said the pianist</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It was my son&rsquo;s favorite song&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

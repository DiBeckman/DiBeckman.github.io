  title of book by Jules de Gautier (1902). It is the habit of conceiving ourselves 
  other than we are; the practice of imagining life as more perfect than it can 
  be and then being bored or angry and rejecting it; characters who attempt to 
  take the desires of other people (or other characters) as their own, seeing 
  them as models to imitate.<br>

  I will apply dietetic measures for the benefit of the sick according to my ability

  not even on sufferers from stone, but will withdraw in favor of such men as 
  are engaged in this work.<br>

  <b>Gustave Flaubert</b> according to Faquet<br>
  &#147;He was a romantic who found reality dull, a realist who found romanticism 
  empty, an artist who found the bourgeois grotesque, and a bourgeois who found 
  artists pretentious, and all this surrounded by a misanthrope who found everyone 
  ridiculous.&#148; <br>

  <b>What is Madame Bovary about?</b> What do you think of these answers?<br>
  The Inadequacy of Dreams<br>
  The Frustration of Dreams<br>
  The Failure of Emma&#146;s Attempt to Find a World Ordered to her Expecatations<br>
  The Book about Nothing </font></p>

  <font color="#000000">&#147;There must have always been unconcrete despair, 
      but no one ever thought of taking it seriously in literary works before&#133;certainly 
      Flaubert is the first who directly captures the chronic character of this psychological 
      situation. Nothing happens but nothing has become a heavy, oppressive, threatening 
      something.&#148;<br>
  Erich Auerbach <i>The Realism of Flaubert</i></font><br>
  <br>
  The very day after the book appeared, people demanded to know the identity of 
  Madame Bovary. When Flaubert feeling persecuted, answered with a statement that 
  was in effect the simple truth&#151;&#147;I am Madame Bovary!&#148; everyone 
  assumed he was joking. Yet could anything be more true, more certain?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &#147;My poor 
  Bovary, without a doubt, is suffering and weeping at this very instant in twenty 
  villages of France.&#148;<br>
  <br>
  To what extent are Emma&#146;s problems those of women of her time, place, and 
  social class?<br>
  <br>
</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&ldquo;[The novel's]  object is to make Emma&rsquo;s existence as intelligible and visible as it may be. We who read the book are to share her sense of life, till no uncertainty is left in it; we are to see and understand her experience, and to see her while she enjoys and endures it; we are to be placed within her world, to get the immediate taste of it, and outside her world as well, to get the full effect, more of it than she herself could see.&rdquo; Percy Lubbock, <em>The Craft of Fiction in Madame Bovary</em> (p. 353).  </font><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  <br>
  How would you defend Flaubert against the charges of immorality for which he 
  was charged? Is there a didactic purpose in his book? Does Flaubert treat Emma&#146;s 
  death as damnation for her sins? her dreams? Is Emma a tragic figure?<b><br>

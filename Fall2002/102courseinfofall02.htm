  <b>PLACEMENT AND PREREQUISITES</b>: Successful completion of FLF 101 at NCSU, 
  transfer credit of its equivalent at another university, or placement into FLF 
  102 on the NCSU Placement Test. If you plan on taking any foreign language class 
  at NCSU besides FL_ 101, you must take the Placement Test which can be taken 
  in the <a href="http://fllab.chass.ncsu.edu">Foreign Language Technology Center 
  </a>(upstairs in the Laundry Building at the corner of Stinson and Current). 
  The test will take 20-25 minutes and you will receive the results immediately.<br>
  <b><br>
  WELCOME TO FRENCH!</b> This course aims at giving you a solid foundation in 
  understanding, speaking, reading and writing the French language at the elementary 
  level. To accomplish these goals, it is essential that we use French as the 
  language of the classroom. Handy phrases for communicating in class:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><i>R&eacute;p&eacute;tez, 
  s'il vous pla&icirc;t</i>. = Repeat, please.<br>
  <i>Comment dit-on [English word]</i>? = How do you say [English word] in French?<br>
  <i>Que veut dire [French word]</i>?= What does [French word] mean ?<br>
  <i>Qu'est-ce que c'est</i>? = What's that?<br>
  <i>Je ne sais pas. </i>= I don't know.<br>
  <i>Je ne comprends pas.</i> = I don't understand.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">I 
  will do my best to keep the class atmosphere creative, lively, and accepting 
  of your best efforts. In return, you, too have some responsibilities. Please 
  read carefully and follow the information and advice given below. <br>
  <b><br>
  GRADING:</b> Your grade in this course will be computed as follows:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> 
  Participation, Class Work, Email Sentences 25%<br>
  Homework 10%<br>
  Quizzes 15%<br>
  Three Exams 25%<br>
  Departmental Common Final Exam 25%</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">There 
  will be plus/minus grading in this class. The scale will be as follows:</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> 
  A+ = 97.0-100, A = 93.0-96.9, A- = 90.0-92.9, B+ = 87.0-89.9, B =83.0-86.9, 
  B- = 80.0-82.9, C+ = 77.0-79.9, C = 73.0-76.9, C- = 70.0-72.9, D+ = 67.0-69.9, 
  D = 63.0-66.9, D- = 60.0-62.9, F= 59.9 and below.<br>
  <br>
  <b>ATTENDANCE REGULATIONS</b>: Attendance is required and will be taken daily. 
  You can make progress in your language learning only if you hear and speak the 
  language regularly. You are permitted two absences in a class taught Tuesday/ 
  Thursday with no penalty.<b> Each additional absence will reduce your class 
  participation grade by one grade (from A to A-, from B+ to B, etc.).</b> See 
  me as soon as possible after an absence and provide a <b>written</b> excuse 
  to be accepted at my discretion (in case of illness, injury, death or illness 
  in the family, university duties, court attendance, or religious observance.) 
  This policy is based upon the University Attendance Policy. Save your absences 
  for emergencies. Excessive absences may lead to an F for the course.<br>
  <br>
  If you need to miss a class for one of the reasons listed above, let me know 
  before the class meeting, if possible. Upon your return to class, you are responsible 
  for all work missed and for any assignments announced during your absence. I 
  suggest that you get the name and phone number of a classmate to call in the 
  event that you are unsure of an assignment.<br>
  <br>
  <b>EXAMS AND QUIZZES</b>: There will be quizzes throughout the semester and 
  three class-long exams, in addition to a departmental final exam. Only chapter 
  quizzes are listed on the syllabus; there will also be 5-minute quizzes announced 
  ahead of time in class. There will be no make-up quizzes for credit. However, 
  your lowest 2 quiz grades will not count. Make-up for exams will be granted 
  only if you are excused in advance with proper documentation. <br>
  <br>
  &#149; The oral part of the final exam will be given during the last week of 
  classes before final exams. Note the dates on the syllabus.<br>
  <br>
  <b>HOMEWORK</b>: Each chapter of the textbook is divided into two parts: 1) 
  <i>Activit&eacute;s et lectures</i> followed by the <i>Vocabulaire</i> section 
  (white pages) and 2) <i>Grammaire et exercices</i> pages (blue pages). <br>
  <br>
  Before each class, you need to prepare the following:<br>
  <br>
  1) Read and write out the exercises in the appropriate sections of the blue 
  pages. You may choose to do either even or odd questions in each exercise. Check 
  your work using a pen or pencil in a <b>different color </b>using the Answer 
  Key in Appendix D of the text book (p. 449). I will correct the &quot;Answers 
  may vary&quot; exercises. In the margin, jot down any questions you have as 
  you correct your work. If you are having problems with a particular section, 
  do all the questions.<br>
  <br>
  2) Do the written and oral exercises assigned in the <i>Cahier.</i> Exercises 
  with a <b>cassette symbol</b> are to be completed with the tapes available in 
  the Foreign Language Technology Center. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">It's 
  much better to listen to the tapes in short sessions several times during the 
  week than do everything in one long session. If you don't understand the directions 
  for an exercise, please check with me. You may do even or odd questions in each 
  exercise. With the listening exercises, it may be easier to do them all, rather 
  than to try to do even and odd. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Correct 
  your workbook exercises using the Answer Key purchased with your textbook<i>.</i> 
  All exercises should be corrected clearly in a different color. I will correct 
  the &quot;Answers may vary&quot; and writing exercises. Mark any sections you 
  don't understand so that you can ask about them in class or I can explain when 
  I'm correcting your work</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Due 
  dates for homework (in both textbook and <i>Cahier</i>) are listed on the syllabus. 
  Full credit will be given only for corrected work turned in on time. </b><br>
  <br>
  We will cover chapters 6-10 in FLF 102. <br>
  <br>
  <b>E-MAIL SENTENCES: </b>Beginning the third week in class, each student will 
  choose an email partner. For each chapter of the textbook, the pair exchanges 
  emails of at least 5 sentences each on a topic of your choice or one that I 
  will suggest. The entire transcript of emails must be emailed to me by one partner 
  by 8 PM on the date that the homework for the chapter is due. This assignment 
  will count as part of your participation grade.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>WRITTEN 
  WORK: DO</b> use regular or online dictionaries to find French or English equivalents 
  for individual words. For example:<br>
  <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/tr">http://babelfish.altavista.com/tr</a><br>
  <a href="http://humanities.uchicago.edu/forms_unrest/FR-ENG.html">http://humanities.uchicago.edu/forms_unrest/FR-ENG.html</a><br>
  However, do <b>NOT</b> use online translators for phrases or sentences for written 
  assignments. The results are poor and will violate Academic Integrity. (See 
  below.) <br>
  <br>
  <b>EXTRA CREDIT</b>: You can earn extra credit towards your participation grade 
  by turning in written work related to our class, such as the translation of 
  a song we have listened to in class or the account of a French meal you have 
  cooked. You may also research a French person or topic related to your major, 
  write about a French film or video you have seen (use the <a href="filmsheet.html">Film 
  Study Sheet</a>), see a French-related exhibit at the Art Museum, or complete 
  <i>Deux Mondes</i> CD-ROM, video, or Internet activities, such as <i>Cliquez-l&agrave;</i> 
  or those available at <a href="http://www.mhhe.com/deuxmondes/">www.mhhe.com/deuxmondes</a>. 
  See me with any questions.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>LANGUAGE 
  LAB</b>: The audiocassette listening program is coordinated with the textbook 
  and the <i>Cahier</i>. The homework assignments are listed on your syllabus. 
  You have two options for completing these exercises. You may go to the Foreign 
  Language Technology Center and listen to the tape there while completing the 
  exercises in the <i>Cahier, </i>or you may have the tape copied to listen to 
  at home. To do so, bring one or two 90-minute blank tapes of good quality (TDK, 
  Maxell, Sony) to the Language Lab and indicate which lesson you wish recorded. 
  You will be told when you can pick up the recorded lesson. Copyright restrictions 
  forbid your taping all of the lessons at once. You will therefore use the same 
  one or two audio tapes for the entire semester; succeeding lessons are taped 
  over the previous ones. You must ask for tape series <b>1AJ</b>. Be sure to 
  begin with Chapter 6.<br>
  <br>
  Exercises in the <i>Cahier</i> with a video-cassette symbol can be completed 
  by using the <i>Video to Accompany Deux Mondes</i> available in the Foreign 
  Language Technology Center. The Center is open Monday-Thursday 8 AM-9 PM, Friday 
  8 AM-5 PM, Saturday 12-4 PM, and is closed on Sunday. For more information visit 
  the <a href="http://fllab.chass.ncsu.edu"> Foreign Language Technology Center</a> 
  pages.<br>
  <br>
  <b>SUPPLEMENTAL COMPUTER EXERCISES</b>: The Foreign Language Technology Center 
  has additional computer-based exercises for students who wish further language 
  practice. I can also provide supplementary exercises for grammar points you 
  don't understand.<br>
  <br>
  <b>FILM</b>: You are required to see <i>Mama, There's a Man in Your Bed (Romuald 
  et Juliette),</i> a French film with English subtitles. See your syllabus for 
  dates and times. <br>
  <br>
  <b>HONOR CODE</b>: The Foreign Language Department takes the University Policy 
  on Academic Integrity very seriously. If you do not already have the pamphlet 
  explaining this NCSU policy, ask your advisor for one. In accordance with this 
  policy, you will be required to sign the Honor Pledge on every test and quiz 
  that you take in this class. The Honor Pledge reads: &quot;I have neither given 
  nor received any unauthorized aid on this test.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  <b>TUTORING ASSISTANCE:</b> Academic Support Services in Room 147 Leazar Hall 
  (near the Bell Tower) offers free tutoring beginning the third week of the semester. 
  Please see me right away if you are experiencing problems or if reasonable accommodation 
  needs to be made in the case of hearing, visual, motor, or learning disabilities. 
  I'm always available if you need help.<br>
  <br>
  <b>STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES</b>: All students currently registered with Disability 
  Services for Students (DSS) must provide each faculty member with an accommodation 
  letter. This letter verifies that appropriate medical documentation is on file 
  and that the student has a substantiated disability requiring effective reasonable 
  accommodations. Any student requesting accommodations without this letter must 
  see a DSS counselor in Suite 1900, Student Health Center. Students with disabilities 
  who possess an accommodation letter from DSS should schedule an appointment 
  with the instructor immediately. <br>
  <br>
  DSS services can be found at their web site at <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/equal_op/dss/">http://www.ncsu.edu/equal_op/dss/</a> 
  or call the office directly at 919-515-7653. <br>
  <br>
  <b>FRENCH CLUB</b>: Consider joining the French Club. You will get extra exposure 
  to the language. I will let you know when the meetings will take place. <br>
  <br>
  <b>SUMMER PROGRAM IN LILLE, FRANCE</b>: Would you like to spend 5 weeks (first 
  summer session) travelling and studying in France this summer? Ask me for more 
  information or contact Diane Fagin Adler, Director, at <a href="mailto:adlerd@social.chass.ncsu.edu">adlerd@social.chass.ncsu.edu</a><br>

  <b><br>
  HOW TO DO WELL IN CLASS: </b><br>
  <br>
  1. Prepare all your assignments before coming to class so that we can devote 
  our in-class sessions to communicative activities rather than learning grammar. 
  Assignments are due for class on the day indicated on the syllabus. Don't get 
  behind or allow yourself to stay confused. It's much easier to keep up than 
  to catch up!<br>
  <br>
  2. ACTIVELY participate in each lesson. Mentally answer each and every question 
  by practicing each answer under your breath while a classmate is responding. 
  <br>
  <br>
  3. TAKE RISKS!! Speak out. Don't be afraid to make mistakes. The more you speak, 
  the better you will get. The more fun you have speaking French, the more you 
  will learn.<br>
  <br>
  4. Speak French in the classroom. Speak French outside of the classroom at every 
  opportunity. <br>
  <br>
  5. Do not chew gum in class. Having something in your mouth makes it harder 
  to use correct pronunciation.<br>
  <br>
  6. TAKE NOTES. Write down everything from the blackboard. If you don't have 
  enough time in class to get everything down, I will be happy to share materials 
  with you after class or in my office.<br>
  <br>
  <b>I look forward to a pleasant and productive semester! Don't hesitate to ask 
  me for help and assistance in person or by </b><a href="mailto:dibeckman@aol.com">email</a>.

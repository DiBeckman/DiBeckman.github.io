  <h2 class="class">Class 2 (Pope, Lecture 1) <span class="date">due Wednesday, January 12</span></h2>
  <p> Read the argument (summary) and first stanza of Pope's <span class="text">Essay on Man</span>. Write a page about the first stanza (lines 1-16) answering Shannon's 4 questions*.</p>
  <ol class="unspaced">
    <li>What is confusing?</li>
    <li>What is repeated?</li>
    <li>What is familiar?</li>
    <li>What is strange?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>*This and all subsequent references to Shannon are from Edward Shannon's <span class="text">The Prentice Hall Guide to Writing about Literature</span> (Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2002) which went out of print in 2010. I have replaced it with <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> this semester. </p>
  <p> Print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222Enlightenment.html">The Enlightenment</a> and <a href="222GreatChain.html">The Great Chain of Being</a></p>
  <p>Write a one-paragraph to one-page summary of Chapter 1 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>. Include the main points and any others that seem especially helpful or surprising to you. You may write or type it on the same page with your discussion of the first stanza of <span class="text">Essay on Man.</span></p>
  <p>In addition, for this and the next assignment, take a look at  my web page on <a href="Explication.html"><em>Explication de Texte</em></a> and these web sites about figures of speech which are also listed on the handy <a href="222supmatf04.html">Supplementary Materials</a> page. These pages will  be useful for your <a href="222poetrypresentation.html">Poetry Presentation</a> due <span class="date">Wednesday, February 2, </span> and <span class="date">Friday, February 4</span>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Here is <a href="http://grammar.about.com/od/terms/a/revquiz20terms.htm?p=1">a quiz</a> you can take to assess your knowledge of the &quot;Top 20 figures of speech&quot; by Richard Norquist.</li>
    <li> <a href="http://www.nipissingu.ca/faculty/williams/figofspe.htm">This site</a> contains figures of speech, thought, repetition, more than you can shake a stick at! Most examples are drawn from Shakespeare. </li>
    <li> <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/rhetoricaldevicesinsound.htm">This site</a> is very cool because it has sound clips and draws from a wide range of speeches, movies, and more to illustrate the Figures of Speech. For example, see and listen to quotes from Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln, and Neil Armstrong on <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/figures/antithesis.htm">the page about antitheses</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="class">Class 3 (Pope, Lecture 2) <span class="date">due Friday, January 14</span></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Print out <a href="AcademicIntegrityPledge.html">Academic Integrity form</a>. Please sign, date, and turn in. </li>
    <li>Read <span class="text">Essay on Man</span> and write a page about your stanza to turn in. In case you're not sure what a <em>stanza</em> is, you can look this and other literary terms up in our course <a href="222Glossary.html">Glossary</a>, the Glossary in Appendix B of <span class="text">A Short Guide to Writing About Literature</span>, or a web site such as <a href="http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms.html">http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms.html</a>. <br />
      <br />
      Note that the Roman numerals I-X at the beginning of each stanza correspond to your assigned stanza number (not a page or line number). What is the stanza about? Give a one sentence summary. Answer the Shannon's 4 questions. Also, what are the key words and images in the stanza? How does the stanza connect with the ideas of the Enlightenment we've discussed? What is  the attitude of the narrator? What is the role of nature, especially animals, if any appear in your stanza?</li>
    <li>Write a one-paragraph to one-page summary of Chapter 2 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>. </li>

      <h2 class="class">Class 4 (Voltaire, Lecture 1) <span class="date"> due Wednesday, January 19</span></h2>
      <ol class="spaced">
        <li> Print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222ShortStoryNovel.html">Different Forms of Prose Fiction</a>; <a href="222SatireIronyUtopia.html">Satire, Irony and Utopia</a>. Read <a href="222Panglossian.htm">Panglossian</a>. </li>
        <li> Write a page about the first thirteen chapters of <span class="text">Candide</span> answering Shannon's 4 questions.</li>
        <li> Read Chapter 10 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> and summarize. </li>
        <li> Weekly vocabulary quizzes? I recommend that you sign up for the free edition of Anu Gang's <a href="http://wordsmith.org/awad/subscribe.html">A Word a Day</a>. The past two  semesters, a student volunteer prepared a 5-question matching quiz based on the week's words that was posted on the board each Friday. He received a bonus of 2 points on his final grade for writing and bringing the quizzes to class each Friday. Students wrote the answers to the quiz on their homework and I added a point on the midterm or final each time a student got 3 quizzes completely correct. We will do this again provided I have a volunteer quiz-meister. <a href="mailto:Diane_Beckman@ncsu.edu">Email</a> me if you are interested: first come, first served. </li>
        <li>Consider bookmarking an online dictionary, such as <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/">dictionary.com</a> or <a href="http://www.m-w.com/">Merriam-Webster</a> to make it easy to look up words you don't know. If you are doing the Reading Notebook, you can print out the definitions to include in your notebook. </li>
      </ol>
<h2 class="class">Class 5 (Voltaire, Lecture 2) <span class="date">due Friday, January 21</span></h2>
      <ol>
        <li> Discuss the following questions after you do the reading assignment (Chapters 14-22). Quote from the text with examples to support your answers and include the page reference for each quotation.
          <ul>
            <li>Is Eldorado a genuine utopia or (in one critic's words) &quot;a colossal bore&hellip;satirized by Voltaire as foolish and futile&quot;?</li>
            <li>Which specific behaviors or institutions show us that Voltaire wants the reader to see Eldorado as utopic?</li>
            <li>Does Voltaire have a philosophical lesson in mind or is it pure satire? Or both?</li>
            <li>How does it correspond to your personal view of Utopia?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>See Lecture Notes on <a href="222dulce.html">Dulce et utile</a>.</li>
        <li>The first original contribution post&mdash;on Pope&mdash;is due Friday at midnight. You will have many authors to choose from to do your required 13 posts (7 original contributions and 6 responses), but I encourage you to get in the habit of posting by starting with Pope or Voltaire. For an original contribution post, make a point or develop an argument of at least 7 lines based on something you read, learned or thought while reading <em>An Essay on Man</em>. Ask a question or make a provocative statement for your classmates to respond to. Did something in your homework get praise or a lot of comment from me? If so, it might be the basis of a good post. </li>
      </ol>
      <h2><span class="class">Class 6 (Voltaire, Lecture 3)</span> <span class="date">due Monday, January 24</span></h2>
      <p>Read the page in Supplementary Materials, <a href="Candide%20quotes.html">Quotes from different critics about &quot;Il faut cultiver notre jardin.&quot;</a> Write a page which includes answers to the following questions: what are some  literal and figurative meanings of the word <em>garden</em>? How do they apply to Candide's garden? How do <strong>you</strong> interpret the final line of the story? </p>
      <p>To help you to understand the difference between <strong>literal</strong> and <strong>figurative</strong>, here is  an example I found online:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>literal</strong> vs. <strong>figurative</strong> meaning - relates to the meanings of words and phrases or expressions. For example, &quot;She was all ears&quot; has a <strong>figurative</strong> meaning (She was listening intently) as well as a <strong>literal</strong> meaning (Her body was composed of ears or she had a huge set of ears). <span class="citation"><a href="http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm">Literary Terms for English</a></span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Read <em>A Short Guide</em>, Chapter 3 and write a summary to turn in. </p>

      <p>Writing assignment: Summing up Romanticism (serves as Lightning for the Poetry Presentation classes, for students doing Reading Notebooks).</p>
      <ul>
        <li> How was romantic literature different from what you expected? (If it wasn't different, explain why not.) </li>
        <li>Which was your favorite piece? Why?</li>
        <li> Choose 4 elements of romanticism from <a href="222Enlitenmentcf.html">A Comparison between the Enlightenment and Romanticism</a> and illustrate each element with evidence (a quoted example) from a  romantic text that you have read over the past two weeks. Use a different romantic text for each element. </li>
  </ul>

          <div class="maroon">
            <h3>FORMALIST CRITICISM:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>How does Flaubert's inserting comments and thoughts from different characters and himself influence the readers' impressions?</li>
              <li>How does Flaubert use descriptions and writing style to make the reader feel the same way that the character feels?</li>
              <li>How does Emma's insatiable desire for passionate affairs relate to her Romantic sensibility?</li>
              <li> Would the author be successful as a Romantic author?</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <h3>SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
          <div class="red">
            <h4>Marxist Criticism:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Do you believe that Emma's unhappiness stems from her place in the bourgeoisie and her infatuation with the aristocracy? What do you think this criticism reveals about Flaubert's feelings on the social structure of the time?</li>
              <li>Flaubert obviously makes the differences in social class quite obvious as he portrays Emma's longings for a more sophisticated lifestyle. Is he showing contempt for the strict class differences of the time or simply emphasizing one of Emma's many flaws?</li>
              <li>Does Emma's lack of financial security with Charles compel her to seek love with men with money?</li>
              <li>How does the character's social class help/hurt their chances in Romantic ways? Is it different for men and women?</li>
              <li>In what ways does the author criticize class structure?</li>
              <li>Throughout the work, the author gives details on clothing and other features which describe the character's social standing. Also, Emma is constantly wishing she could go back and live as part of the elite upper class. What is the author trying to say about the relationship of being part of the upper class and happiness?</li>
              <li>Clearly, Flaubert is aware of class distinction and the struggle of the proletariat, given the Agricultural show, but is this enough to claim the novel is Marxist? To be considered as such, I think the theme of the alienation of the bourgeois from their work and themselves must be shown.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="purple">
            <h4>Feminist Criticism: </h4>
            <ul>
              <li>What role do women play in the work?</li>
              <li>Did Flaubert represent Emma as a true deptiction of women during this time period?</li>
              <li>Throughout this story, Emma Bovary is very unhappy in her life with Charles. She is not content with living in a small rural village with the amount of money Charles can provide her. We see her as a powerless human being. What is Flaubert's opinion on the role of women in society? Explain by citing specific examples from the text.</li>
              <li>In the first full paragraph of pages 1089, Emma, during her pregnancy, expresses that she wants to have a son. She suggests that her son could enjoy the many freedoms that are not available to women. Was this a feeling shared by most women of this time or is Emma just being overdramatic or is Flaubert trying to initiate discussion about the inequalities of women in this time?</li>
              <li>Is the relationship between Leon and Emma in any way beneficial to the two of them or anyone involved in their lives? If so, in what way are there positives? If not, in what way are their actions negative?</li>
              <li>What gender schemas does the author created toward the women in the work?</li>
              <li>Is Emma's status in her community reinforced by societal norms of the time period or due to her actions and choices?</li>
              <li>How would a feminist react to Emma's behavior in her marriage?</li>
              <li>What was the role of women in society during the time this work was written? Did Flaubert conform to the norms of society?<br />
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="teal">
            <h3>CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Because <em>Madame Bovary</em> was such a popular work, do you think the gender stereotypes in the novel reflect the current society or created influence on the society?</li>
              <li>How does the context of medical knowledge play a role in the plot of <em>Madame Bovary</em>?</li>
              <li>If we read <em>Madame Bovary</em> when it was written or sometime around 1856, how would we view the story differently than today? With how we view infidelity and debt in our society today, Emma's acts are not as astonishing as they were for the time it was written. This makes me wonder if <em>Madame Bovary</em> was more influential at the time since people could connect to it better than we do today. </li>
              <li>What is the impact of the Industrial Revolution on <em>Madame Bovary</em>?</li>
              <li>How are laws and cultural images of marriage reflected in the story? Does this refelct the dismal state marrage is in, in this day and age?</li>
              <li>How is the use of citing historical events and people in <em>Madame Bovary</em> reveal the general interests and entertainment during the period of the novel's setting?</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="orange">
            <h3>PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Flaubert does not seem to be a realist but a pessimist. Humans have an amazing ability to find joy in suffering and life	 does seem to have as much suffering as Flaubert describes in <em>Madame Bovary</em>. Is Flaubert exaggerating for a reason 	or does this pessimism reflect his real view of life?</li>
              <li>Is it natural for the human mind to be excited about something and then get bored with it as time progresses?</li>
              <li>The &quot;Unhappiness&quot; Hypothesis: Are people better off alone than in a serious relationships? Are relationships responsible for people's unhappiness or are the more chemical reasons? Do you think Emma would have been better off along. If she were still on the farm, how would her life be different? WOULD SHE BE HAPPY? * Why do you think Emma is so fundamentally unhappy? What makes her think that she is too good for Charles? Do you believe that something is clinically (medically) wrong with her--or do you think this is normal? Do you think that in any kind of relationship there is some degree of dissatisfaction that each person experiences, and that maybe Emma is just more vocal about it? Explain.</li>
              <li>Emma displays many symptoms of an unstable manic depressive woman as she oscillates between depression and delusional happiness as she often has opportunistic love affairs and goes on spending sprees to alleviate her misery, ultimately leaving her in insurmountable debt. Do you think that Flaubert uses Emma's character to make fun of the romantic period for misleading people into obsessing over unrealistic ideas such as fate and that everyone has a soul mate, or does his use of Charles being so naive about Emma's unfaithfulness and clear psychosis (he is a doctor after all) reflect upon his own psychology when he was a younger adult? </li>
              <li>Does Flaubert's characterization of Charles convey his own personal belief that individuals who are less progressive (i.e. a country doctor during industrialization) are generally more aloof and ignorant of the reality going on around them or is Charles's character just a good &quot;punching bag&quot; for Emma's character?</li>
              <li>While we tend to focus on Emma's personality and self-destructive behavior led to her downfall, we tend to forget how Charles' personality led to his own death. In what ways did Charles' personality contribute to his own death?</li>
              <li>Is Emma truly in love with Léon or is it part of her fulfilling her idealistic criterion?</li>
              <li>What does Emma meeting Léon in secret reveal about her personality?</li>
              <li>In the year 2011, how does Flaubert's depiction of Emma coincide or contradict, specifically her constant bouts with depression and elation, with today's common knowledge of psychological disorders?</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="blue">
            <h3>READER RESPONSE CRITICISM:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li> Flaubert forces us to confront the human capacity for emptiness. Emma can't see beyond her stereotypes and vainly searches for what she thinks is happiness. Have you ever experienced insatiability? If so, how did you overcome that obstacle and satisfy yourself?</li>
              <li>Do you think a good amount of today's relationships can be compared with Charles and Emma's marriage?</li>
              <li>What do Emma's ideals for love have in common with her financial debt?</li>
              <li>Describe your response to how Rodolphe manipulates and takes advantage of Emma. Do you feel any sympathy for Emma or do you feel Emma deserves it? How do your experiences and expectations affect your reading and interpretation?</li>
              <li>Was Emma blind to the fact that her financial situation would eventually catch up with her? Is this financial situation due to the same character traits that plagued Emma's romantic life?</li>
              <li>Does anyone in your life remind you of Emma? Why?</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="green">
            <h3>ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Flaubert references the dead cactuses for a reason (p. 1178). What could the relationship and the death of the cactuses be compared to?</li>
              <li>How does a character's social status define the nature of food and quantity of it?</li>
              <li>How do Emma's dreams of her perfect romantic environment contrast with her real &quot;dull countryside, imbecile petty bourgeois, life in its ordinariness&quot; environment?</li>
              <li>After reading the last paragraph p. 1191, what specific environmental aspects describe the love that has resurfaced between Emma and Léon when they visit the Hôtel de Boulogne on the river front in Chapter iii of Part III. &quot;They sat down in the low-ceilinged room of a tavern, at whose door hung black mats. They ate fried smelts, cream, and cherries. The lay down upon the grass; they kissed behind the poplars; and they would fain, like two Robinsons, have lived forever in this little place, which seemed to them in their beatitude the most magnificent place on earth. It was not the first time they had seen trees, a blue sky, meadows; that htey had heard the water flowing and the wind blowing in the leaves; but, no doubt, they had never admired all this, as if Nature had not existed before, or had only begun to be beautiful since the gratification of their desires.&quot;</li>
              <li>How does the ecological environment affect the development of relationships in <em>Madame Bovary</em>?</li>
              <li>How does Emma's upbringing on the farm impact her lifestyle as being a domesticated wife with Charles, and later when he moves to another city?</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="fuchsia">
            <h3>QUEER THEORY: </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Is Emma's infidelity due to her displeasure with Charles or to her displeasure with her social standing?</li>
              <li>How does the work reflect attitudes towards gender roles and sexuality?  What are the connections between social class, gender and race to sexuality in the work?</li>
              <li>Do you think Emma acted immmaturely because she had no other way to express herself?</li>
              <li>Emma is stuck in her marriage with Charles, since divorce is not an option in these times. Would Flaubert's story hold any significance in present times or would it come off as yet another unhappy marriage that we see all too often?</li>
              <li>Sexuality is a very important aspect of <em>Madame Bovary</em>. Sex is portrayed in many different relationships throughout the work. How do you feel about the way sex is presented in <em>Madame Bovary</em>: does it represent love and marriage? Or does sex create an illusion of love?</li>
              <li>How does Flaubert's explicit (for the time) portrayal of sex and extramarital affairs help Flaubert to rant about his discontent with the Bourgeoisie?</li>
            </ul>

Keep Margaret Atwood's quote in mind: <span class="class">The answers you get from literature depend on the questions you pose.</span></p>
<div class="maroon">
  <h3>FORMALIST CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Why do you think Kafka put what could arguably be the climax of the story in the very first sentence?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h3>SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
<div class="red">
  <h4>Marxist Criticism:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>How does Gregor's metamorphosis change his role as the breadwinner of the household, and how does this change how the family perceives him?</li>
    <li>Is Gregor Samsa's inability to work the source of his family's disgusted judgments about him?</li>
    <li>Is Gregor's new physical appearance a metaphor for his life as an underappreciated salesman?</li>
    <li>How does Gregory's family's economic situation determine his and his family's lives?</li>
    <li>How does Kafka criticize/call attention to class relations?</li>
    <li>What role do you think Gregor's family's financial status and his being the breadwinner played in his metamorphosis into a bug? What is Kafka trying to teach us?</li>
    <li>How is Gregor's metamorphosis simply a symbol of his work life?</li>
    <li>How do economic conditions determine the lives of all the members of the Samsa family?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="purple">
  <h4>Feminist Criticism: </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>How does Meg represent the traditional and oppressed woman of the period in which the novella was written?</li>
    <li>How (and why) does the role of the sister and the role of the mother change toward Gregory after his transformation?</li>
    <li>When Gregory's mother initially encounters Gregory's metamorphosis in Part I, why does Kafka have her collapse into a state of shock? Also, why does she beg Gregory's father not to hurt Gregory at the end of Part II?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="teal">
  <h3>CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Kafka grew up as an outcast and stranger in his country. How are people that speak different languages other than the native language of the country viewed? How do they fit into society. For example, French Canadians, English in South Africa, and Spanish in our own country? Without being able to communicate with most people, do they feel like  giant bugs that no one can understand?</li>
    <li>Do you think that Gregory's metamorphosis into a bug represents how the working class felt during in the time period in which this story was written?</li>
    <li>What is the impact of the industrial era and his family on Gregor? How does this reflect on him?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="orange">
  <h3>PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Could the bug just be a symbol by Kafka to represent changes in a character's psychological state which could cut communications, etc?</li>
    <li>How does Gregor's &quot;bug&quot; state affect him and his family?</li>
    <li>What aspects of Gregor's metamophosis and corresponding change in the functioning of his family might say about Franz Kafka's real family experience? Is <em>The Metamorphosis</em> a reflection of Kafka's own psychology?</li>
    <li>While Kafka claims that there is no underlying message, what are some controversial situations that warrant similar reaction from family members and society?</li>
    <li>What do Gregory Samsa's interactions with his family after his metamorphosis symbolize?</li>
    <li>Do you think that Gregory's family would have accepted his transformation better if he had retained his ability to speak understandably?</li>
    <li>Is Gregor of sound mind?</li>
    <li>Why was Gregory a bug (insect) when he woke up? What does it symbolize? Uncleanliness? Is it real?</li>
    <li>What does it symbolize when Gregor Samsa's father throws an apple that pierces his back?</li>
    <li>What do <strong>you</strong> think Gregor's transformation represents?</li>
    <li>When Gregory wakes up in his condition, he seems more concerned with getting to work than his current condition. What do you think this says about Gregory's psychological state of mind?</li>
    <li>Does anyone in your life remind you of Gregor Samsa?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="blue">
  <h3>READER RESPONSE CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How would you feel if you woke up one morning and realized you were suddenly an insect?</li>
    <li>From the reader's perspective, how does the description of Gregory as a physically frightening and grostesque insect connect with a personal experience in which the reader felt that some handicap kept him/her from accomplishing a goal (in the case of the story, Gregory's goal of keeping his family financially stable)?</li>
    <li>Describe your reaction to Gregor's outward metamorphosis. Do you think the author left out the details of the bug's appearance and identity for a reason? Do you think it is up to our interpretation which kind of bug it is?</li>
    <li>Can many families today be compared to Gregory and his family?</li>
    <li>Why do you think Gregory is less concerned with figuring out why he is a bug than explaining his appearance to his family and boss?</li>
    <li>Does Gregor's family remind you of anyone you know?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="green">
  <h3>ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM:  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How did he turn into a bug? What does it mean?</li>
    <li>Why do you think Kafka decided to turn Gregor into a giant bug rahter than any other type of creature or animal?</li>
    <li>When reading &quot;his many legs: and that he bled brown fluid, what insect does it seem he has turned into?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="fuchsia">
  <h3>QUEER THEORY: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How does <em>The Metamorphosis</em><em></em> compare with the coming out of gay children?</li>
    <li>How is the reaction to Gregory different from the female point of view and the male point of view?</li>
    <li>How do perceived gender roles of the time influence how Gregor's family interacts with him?</li>
    <li>When Gregory climbs on the picture, he presses his body against it and it &quot;offered [his belly] a firm purchase and did his hot belly good.&quot; Is this just a comforting feeling of something familiar or is there a deeper, possibly sexual, meaning there?</li>
    <li>Suppose a friend approaches you and tells you that they have realized they are bisexual and now want you to refer to them as the opposite sex and call them a different name from before. Does this story help you understand this person's situation more? Would you suggest that they read it?</li>
  </ul>

<h2><span class="class">Class 36 (Thesis exercise and Peer review of Term Paper) </span><span class="date">due Monday, April 11</span></h2>
<p>The first part of class will be devoted to <em>The Thesis Exercise</em>. Read the <a href="222Thesis exercise.html">web page</a> about how to write a thesis for a literary paper. Print and fill out the <a href="222Theses.html">page of sample FL 222 theses</a> where you rate the examples. The second half of class will be devoted to peer review of the first draft of your <a href="222Paper2010.html">Paper</a>. Print out <strong>two copies</strong> of the <a href="Peerevaluation2.pdf">Peer Review Feedback Form</a> to include with the <strong>two copies</strong> of your draft which you will bring for your classmates. Fill out the top part of the form with your name, paper title, and date. Do <strong>not wait</strong> until the last minute to print these materials out. Email me before class if you have an idea for your own original topic so that I can approve it. Speaking of original, a very creative paper where almost all the main characters meet in Hell written by a former student is featured <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~dsbeckma/To Hell with Literature.htm"> here</a>, and my favorite missing chapter of <em>Candide</em> is <a href="222VoltaireCandide.html">here</a>: </p>
<p>Selected writing advice from the <a href="222Paper2010.html">Term Paper page:</a></p>
<h3>Choose your topic</h3>
<p>Read through the topic choices below. Consult Chapter 10 in <span class="text"> A Short Guide, Writing about Fiction: the World of the Story</span>, especially the pages on &quot;Getting Ideas&quot; (171-5).  Which texts have been your favorite or challenged you the most? Send me an email or make an appointment if you need help deciding on a topic. </p>
<h3>Steps for writing </h3>
<p>Step 1: read, re-read and annotate your texts; write preliminary notes; build up to a fully formulated thesis. A thesis is a clear and specific argument, not a list, not an opinion, not an obvious fact.</p>
<p>See the <a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/course/FL/222">Library Tools</a> page to see resources available to you from NCSU libraries. </p>
<p>Step 2: Following <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>, Chapter 3; write a first draft of 1-2 pages about one of the topics below for the peer review session. It should have a working title and a fully formulated introduction (you can rewrite them later, but they need to be there for the draft) and several finished paragraphs; your audience knows the text, so you should avoid plot summaries. Use the present tense for literary analysis: Ivan <strong>is</strong> an ambitious&hellip; Flaubert <strong>reveals</strong>&hellip; Include your outline. This is the peer review draft version of your paper; print and bring 2 copies of it to class. Include the <a href="Peerevaluation2.pdf">Peer Review Feedback form</a> with each copy.</p>
<p>Some useful pages (among many) about writing:</p>
<ul>
  <li> For the difference between formal and informal style: <a href="http://www.mondofacto.com/study-skills/writing/how-to-use-academic-writing-style/04.html">http://www.mondofacto.com/study-skills/writing/how-to-use-academic-writing-style/04.html</a>.</li>
  <li>For guidelines about  commas, see <a href="http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/commas.html">http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/commas.html</a></li>
  <li>For writing anxiety or writer's block, see <a href="http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/writing_anxiety.html">http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/writing_anxiety.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. Beckman's hint about titles: A dull title sets expectations low. A good title invites the reader! Quotes, proverbs or aphorisms make great titles. Try a google search with a key word from your thesis (pride, satisfaction, quest, etc) and the word quote. I've already got a <a href="222Lovequotes.html">web page</a> with love quotes for you to use, since love is such a popular topic. </p>
<p>Post due at midnight:  response on Proust.</p>
<h2><span class="class">Class 37 (Woolf 1)</span><span class="date"> due Wednesday, April 13</span></h2>
<p>Print out lecture notes <a href="222VirginiaWoolf.htm">Virginia Woolf and Feminism: a few quotes to consider</a>.</p>
<p>Choose the most provocative or thought-provoking statement in <strong>Chapter 2</strong> (ie not Chapter 1) of the assignment. Include the page number. Write a paragraph (or more) agreeing or disagreeing. Be prepared to read your passage out loud in class and explain why you think it is provocative or thought-provoking.</p>
<p>Reading Notebook Check #3: Wilde, Baudelaire, Verlaine, Chekhov, Mann, Joyce, Kafka, Eliot, Tzara, Breton.</p>
<p>Post due at midnight: original commentary on Kafka, response on Joyce</p>
<h2><span class="class">Class 38 (Woolf 2)</span> <span class="date">due Friday, April 15</span></h2>
<p><span class="red">Alert: Class will be meeting at IHOP on Hillsborough Street today!</span> I will be taking roll and collecting homework. You'll be discussing your answers to the following 3 questions and writing up a group report. I will have some additional passages for you to discuss from Chapter 3 of <span class="text">A Room of One's Own</span> and <span class="text">An Unwritten Novel</span>.<br />
  <br />
  futz, balderdash, grandee, shibboleth, sprightly	</p>
<p>Writing Assignment (answer all 3 questions):</p>
<ol>
  <li> Who is Judith Shakespeare? Why does Woolf create her? What is the message about women and women writers that Woolf suggests by telling Judith's story? Is Judith fact, fiction, truth, a lie?</li>
  <li> Choose any work we've read so far and speculate about how it might have been different if the work had been written by a woman rather than a man. (There is no right or wrong answer: let your imagination take you somewhere. Would the characters be different? The plot? The ending? How does the author's gender impact his or her art?)</li>
  <li> List 3 elements of <a href="222Modernism.html">modernism</a> that you can find in our example of Virginia Woolf's fiction, the very short story, <span class="text">An Unwritten Novel</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="red"> Helpful synopsis of the story and main ideas:</span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> &quot;The narrator, while riding in a train, imagines possible characters and plots for a novel, based on her observations of another passenger whom she calls 'Minnie Marsh.' The narrative alternates between imaginative creation and objective observation, leading the narrator to unexpected discoveries about herself and the nature of art and artistic representation.&quot; <span class="citation"><a href="http://fajardo-acosta.com/worldlit/woolf/unwritten_novel.htm">Fidel Fajardo-Acosta</a></span></p>

<h2><span class="class">Class 40 (Paper Full Draft)</span><span class="date"> due Wednesday, April 21</span></h2>
<p>No class meeting, but  come to the classroom to drop off the complete draft of your paper along with your peer review drafts. See the <a href="222Paper2010.html">Paper</a> page for full details.
  Highlights include:</p>
<p>-Step 3: Reflect on your peer reviewers' suggestions and write a full draft of your paper to turn in to me. Proofread following the <span class="text">Editing</span> and other checklists listed on the inside cover of <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>. I will not grade the paper at this point but will return it to you with comments, so that you can write the final draft. Consult the <a href="222scoringrubric.html">Scoring Rubric for Papers</a> and <a href="222scoringrubric-rewrite.html">Scoring Rubric for Creative Papers</a> so that you'll know what I will be looking for when I do grade the paper.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Chapter 14 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> is an exellent presentation of the style and format I expect in  a literary paper. Pay attention to good organization and logical transitions between paragraphs.</li>
  <li>Base your arguments on close readings of the texts you have chosen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two areas that are normally weak in the first draft are the use of quotations and the conclusion.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Give concrete examples (quotes) from 
    the texts to support your arguments, but not to fill up space.  These quotations are the evidence you need to provide to prove your thesis. You will usually use at least one in each of body paragraphs.</li>
  <li>In order to integrate quotes appropriately, first introduce the quote by making the point, connected to your thesis, that the passage illustrates. Next, include the quote, usually 3-5 lines of text. Finally, tie the quote back into your argument with a concluding sentence in your own words: &quot;&hellip;remind your reader that these passages are there to prove a point. End your discussion on your words, not theirs.&quot; (Shannon, 162-3).</li>
</ul>
<p>A conclusion is very important to a fully developed paper. Go beyond the ideas in your introduction. Have you proved your thesis?  All readers, including your professor, will ask the question: &quot;So what?&quot; The conclusion should make the relevance and importance of your research clear.</p>
<p>You are not required to use secondary sources (books, articles, internet) for this paper, but if you do, be sure to quote and document them properly and attach a &#147;Works Cited&#148; page. <strong>Plagiarism is a poor choice and will not be tolerated</strong>; consult the <a href="222CIsp11.html">Course Information</a> page about the NC State academic integrity policy; ask me if questions remain. For information on using research (if you do) and writing the documentation page, consult <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>, chapter 15.</p>

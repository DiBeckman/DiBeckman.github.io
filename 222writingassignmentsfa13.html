  <p> Complete your <a href="222Morereflections.pdf">More Reflections</a> form to turn in.</p>
  <p>Read the argument (summary) and first stanza of Pope's <span class="text">Essay on Man</span>. Write a page about the first stanza (lines 1-16) answering Shannon's 4 questions*.

    <li>What is confusing?</li>

    <li>What is familiar?</li>
    <li>What is strange?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>*This and all subsequent references to Shannon are from Edward Shannon's <span class="text">The Prentice Hall Guide to Writing about Literature</span> (Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2002) which went out of print in 2010. I  replaced it with <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> as a textbook for our class. Details about what he means by &quot;confusing, repeated, familiar and strange&quot; can be found <a href="222Shannonmore.html">here</a>.</p>
  <p>Write a one-paragraph to one-page summary of Chapter 1 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>. Include the title of each chapter in your heading, since   it should reflect the main point of the chapter. Your summary should include the main points and any others that seem especially helpful or surprising to you. Some students prefer to an outline format or question format. (See <a href="222ShortGuideSample.pdf">this example</a> of a question format.) Outlining, writing questions, and summarizing are all useful skills. You may handwrite or type it, and you may include it on the same page with your discussion of the first stanza of <span class="text">Essay on Man. </span>You may submit<span class="text"> A Short Guide</span> assignments electronically since I will not make extensive comments on them. If they are submitted electronically, they will be returned to you electronically. </p>
  <p> Print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222Enlightenment.html">The Enlightenment</a> and <a href="222GreatChain.html">The Great Chain of Being</a> if you want to use them to take notes.</p>
<p>In addition, for this and the next assignment, take a look at  my web page on <a href="Explication.html"><em>Explication de Texte</em></a> and these web sites about figures of speech which are also listed on the handy <a href="222supmatf04.html">Supplementary Materials</a> page. These pages will  be useful for your <a href="222poetrypresentation.html">Poetry Presentation</a> due on <span class="date">September 13 and 16.</span></p>

    <li>Here is <a href="http://grammar.about.com/od/terms/a/revquiz20terms.htm?p=1">a quiz</a> you can take to assess your knowledge of the &quot;Top 20 figures of speech&quot; by Richard Norquist.</li>
    <li> <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/rhetoricaldevicesinsound.htm">This site</a> is very cool because it has sound clips and draws from a wide range of speeches, movies, and more to illustrate the Figures of Speech. For example, see and listen to quotes from Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln, and Neil Armstrong on <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/figures/antithesis.htm">the page about antitheses</a>.</li>

  <ol>
    <li>Read <span class="text">Essay on Man</span> and write a page about your stanza to turn in. In case you're not sure what a <em>stanza</em> is, you can look this and other literary terms up in our course <a href="222Glossary.html">Glossary</a>, the Glossary in Appendix B of <span class="text">A Short Guide to Writing About Literature</span>, or a web site such as <a href="http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms.html">http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms.html</a>. <br />
      <br />
Note that the Roman numerals I-X at the beginning of each stanza correspond to your assigned stanza number (not a page or line number). What is the stanza about? Give a one-sentence summary. Answer  Shannon's 4 questions. Also, what are the key words and images in the stanza? How does the stanza connect with the ideas of the Enlightenment we've discussed? What is  the attitude of the narrator? What is the role of nature, especially animals, if any appear in your stanza?</li>
    <li>Write a one-paragraph to one-page summary or outline of Chapter 2 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> to turn in. Take, correct, and turn in your answers to the Quiz in Appendix B  364-371 of <span class="text">A Short Guide.</span></li>

<h2 class="class">Class 5 (Voltaire, Lecture 2) <span class="date">due Friday, August 30</span></h2>
<ul><li> Discuss the following questions after you do the reading assignment (Chapters 14-22). Quote from the text with examples to support your answers and include the page reference for each quotation.
          <ul>
            <li>Is Eldorado a genuine utopia or (in one critic's words) &quot;a colossal bore&hellip;satirized by Voltaire as foolish and futile&quot;?</li>
            <li>Which specific behaviors or institutions show us that Voltaire wants the reader to see Eldorado as utopic?</li>
            <li>Does Voltaire have a philosophical lesson in mind or is it pure satire? Or both?</li>
            <li>How does it correspond to your personal view of Utopia?</li></ul>
        </li>
</ul>
<ul><li>See Lecture Notes on <a href="222dulce.html">Dulce et utile</a>.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Read Chapter 3 in <em>A Short Guide</em> and write a summary to turn in.</li></ul>
 <ul><li>The first original contribution post&mdash;on Pope&mdash;is due <span class="date">tonight</span> at midnight. You will have many authors to choose from to do your required 14 posts (7 original contributions and 7 responses), but I encourage you to get in the habit of posting by starting with Pope or Voltaire. For an original contribution post, make a point or develop an argument of at least one  full paragraph (5-8 sentences) based on something you read, learned or thought while reading <em>An Essay on Man</em>. Ask a question or make a provocative statement for your classmates to respond to. You may also include a quote from the text under discussion or links to other web sites. Did something in your homework get praise or a lot of comment from me? If so, it might be the basis of a good post.</li></ul>
          <h2><span class="class">Class 6 (Voltaire, Lecture 3)</span> <span class="date">due Wednesday, September 4</span></h2>
          <p>Read the page in Supplementary Materials, <a href="Candide%20quotes.html">Quotes from different critics about &quot;Il faut cultiver notre jardin.&quot;</a> Write a page which includes answers to the following questions: what are some  literal and figurative meanings of the word <em>garden</em>? How do they apply to Candide's garden? How do <strong>you</strong> interpret the final line of the story? </p>
          <p>To help you to understand the difference between <strong>literal</strong> and <strong>figurative</strong>, here is  an example I found online:</p>
<blockquote>
            <p><strong>literal</strong> vs. <strong>figurative</strong> meaning - relates to the meanings of words and phrases or expressions. For example, &quot;She was all ears&quot; has a <strong>figurative</strong> meaning (She was listening intently) as well as a <strong>literal</strong> meaning (Her body was composed of ears or she had a huge set of ears). <span class="citation"><a href="http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm">Literary Terms for English</a></span></p>

                  <h3>FORMALIST CRITICISM:</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Flaubert is obsessed with finding the perfect word to go in his writing. Thus, every word has a purpose. The characters in <em>Madame Bovary</em> are not only individuals, but also society as a whole. How does Flaubert use imagery to develop his characters and his symbols? </li>
                    <li>Does the pace of  <em>Madame Bovary</em> reflect  Emma's emotions? I noticed that when Emma is bored, melancholy, or unhappy in general, the story seems to drag on, but when she finds passion and excitement, the pace of the story picks up. Do you think Flaubert did this on purpose? Am I the only one who noticed this?</li>
                    <li>We know Flaubert to be particular in his wording(s) and careful to use perfection in his writing. Do we see this practice throughout each book of <em>Madame Bovary</em>? Does he do this with each character description? If not, why might that be?</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
                <div class="red">
                  <h4>Marxist Criticism:</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Can Emma’s corruption be attributed to the materialistic bourgeois? Or was her it her upbringing in the convent?</li>
                    <li>Throughout the novel, there are stark comparisons between the poor and the rich in France's society.  The clear class differences are apparent to Emma, who, although not necessarily poor but also not rich, attempts to move up in class by buying &quot;high-class&quot; and &quot;high fashion&quot; things.  This, ultimately, leads to her financial ruin.  Do you think that the distinct divides between classes from material possessions was the driving force behind why Emma wasn't satisfied with what she had and tried to change her position in society?  Why or why not? </li>
                    <li>How much does Madame Bovary's reliance on money say about her? How much does the role of the debt play on her fate in the end?</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Does <em>Madame Bovary</em> present women in a positive or negative light? Specifically, is Emma's affair a symbol of female empowerment or the inevitable weakness of women?</li>
                    <li>Why do you think the author portrays Emma in such a negative light? Do you think this is an accurate portrayal of how people view women... as rash, unstable, and manipulative?</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>How is Napoleon's influence on French culture portrayed throughout <em>Madame Bovary</em>?</li>
                    <li>What in society caused Flaubert to write about such a normal, boring topic and what political movement, if any, motivated Flaubert to write about the middle class?</li>
                    <li>In <em>Madame Bovary</em>, Flaubert gives us enormous details of the French high class society. Was Flaubert criticizing or praising this high-class society?</li>
                    <li>How does this book reflect the period of society in which it was created?</li>
                    <li>Did the rise in Liberalism and ideas about Evolution impact Flaubert's characters in <em>Madame Bovary</em> at the time? How? </li>
                    <li>In the story although Emma is depressed Flaubert keeps her in her marriage with Charles, is this because the time period divorce wasn't as common, the birth of their daughter, or a bit of both?</li>

                <div class="orange">
                  <h3>PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Emma Bovary is depicted as not truly loving anything except attention and thinking things will solve her problems, such as expensive goods and affairs, even though nothing ever fills the hole within her. Do you think if Madame Bovary existed in the modern era with access to mental health care, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, her life would have turned out differently? Or do you think she wouldn't have cared, resisting treatment until it was too late?</li>
                    <li>Flaubert goes to a great deal of trouble to paint a picture of Emma's emotional and mental state during the course of <em>Madame Bovary</em> in how she interacts with other characters in addition to how she reacts to varying situations that arise. How do these two factors change in Emma and how does Flaubert use these changes to drive and affect the story's plot?</li>

  <ul>
    <li>How does Gregory's transformation relate to the overall theme of the story?</li>
    <li>Is the metamorphosis of the main character what drives the plot of the story?</li>
    <li>How does Gregor's current state of being reflect the pressures caused by work, home, and social obligations and responsibilities?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h3>SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
<div class="red">
  <h4>Marxist Criticism:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Throughout the first half of Kafka's &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;, there are several references to Gregory's work history and his family's financial state.  The concern over money and material possessions is also mentioned all throughout the first half of the story.  Do you think that the family's financial situation due to the father's debt has had an effect on how Gregory now views himself and his position as not only a member of the family but also as an individual?</li>
    <li>How do economic conditions determine the characters' lives in <em>The Metamorphosis</em>?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="purple">
  <h4>Feminist Criticism: </h4>
  <ul>
    
    <li>What does the depiction of the Mother say about women?</li>
                      <li>How do gender roles play a part in the <em>Metamorphosis</em>? How does the way women are treated affect their character development?</li>
                      <li>What is Grete's relationship with Gregor like and how does it change after his transformation?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="teal">
  <h3>CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How does Kafka convey information about the culture and society of the early 1900&rsquo;s through his protagonist Gregory Samsa in <em>The Metamorphosis</em>?</li>
    <li>Traveling salesmen aren't generally considered high on the social scale just as insects aren't high on the food chain. Was Kafka making a statement about how societies views turn inward onto ourselves by making Samsa an insect and becoming disgusted with himself?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="orange">
  <h3>PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Once Gregor is transformed into a bug his behavior and thoughts are still human. As the story goes his actions and thoughts are that of a bug. Can Gregor's new bug life completely replace his old life to the point he has no human behaviors?  If this happens, can he share a moment with a human, or is this the isolation that Kafka foreshadows?</li>
    <li> From a psychological perspective, how does the main character&rsquo;s transformation reflects his deeper concerns? Is this story really a person&rsquo;s dark subconscious revealing something deeper or has Gregor really changed into a monstruous vermin?</li>
    <li>Being that Gregor is a loner, how does this psychological state affect his transformation into an insect? Does the loneliness make it easier or harder to be an insect? Is the loneliness something he has felt before, or is it something that arose after transforming into an insect?<br />
    </li>
    <li>What do the character's emotions and behavior reveal about their psychological states? What types of personalities are they?</li>
    <li>What does Gregor's behavior, when his family and boss find out about his metamorphosis, reveal about his desire?</li>
    <li>Is it possible that <em>The Metamorphosis</em> is a story of Gregory's unconsious mind coming out?</li>
    <li>Why does Gregor never wish he would turn into a human again?</li>
    <li>Why does Gregor turn into a monstruous vermin commonly known for being at the bottom of the food chain and not something more regal like say a butterfly or a toucan? Monstruous vermin type bugs are known for being stepped on. Do you think this is why Kafka chose to turn Gregor into a bug? Because all his does is sacrifice to make others happy?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="blue">
  <h3>READER RESPONSE CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>As a reader, we read this piece about the transformation of Gregory and see the world through his many eyes. Because of this, do you believe that we should separate ourselves and be objective when reading, or feel as Gregory would, about the way that his family is treating him?</li>
    <li>It is evident that Gregor's transformation has a negative effect on his relationship with his family. He views their decision as being very practical and appropriate considering the family. The family members seem to sever Gregor's position in the family. They literally treat him like a bug though he is still himself. He views their decision as being very practical and appropriate considering the family. Do you think their attitude towards him is justifiable? How would you have reacted if you were in the family's position?</li>
    <li>How does the reader respond to the ideal of humanity? Is Gregor still a human after the transformation or is he just a bug?</li>
    <li>What does <em>Metamorphosis</em> insinuate about humanity? More specifically, what does Kafka attempt to say about what makes someone human or inhuman? Where is the line drawn?</li>
    <li>Why does Gregor accept his transformation?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="green">
  <h3>ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Does the lack of setting identification and explanation of the environment affect the reader's comprehension of the story? Why or why not?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="fuchsia">
  <h3>QUEER THEORY: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How does the way Gregory's family treats him after he becomes a vermin similar to the way family and friends react to someone after they admit to being homosexual? </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2><span class="class">Class 35 (Woolf 2)</span> <span class="date">due Friday, November 15</span></h2>
<p><span class="red">Alert: Class will be meeting at IHOP on Hillsborough Street today!</span> I will be taking roll and collecting homework. You'll be discussing your answers to the following 3 questions and writing up a group report. I will have some additional passages for you to discuss from Chapter 3 of <span class="text">A Room of One's Own</span> and <span class="text">An Unwritten Novel</span>.<br />
</p>
<p>Writing Assignment (answer all 3 questions):</p>
<ol>
  <li> Who is Judith Shakespeare? Why does Woolf create her? What is the message about women and women writers that Woolf suggests by telling Judith's story? Is Judith fact, fiction, truth, a lie?</li>
  <li> Choose any work we've read so far and speculate about how it might have been different if the work had been written by a woman rather than a man. (There is no right or wrong answer: let your imagination take you somewhere. Would the characters be different? The plot? The ending? How does the author's gender impact his or her art?)</li>
  <li> List 3 elements of <a href="222Modernism.html">modernism</a> that you can find in our example of Virginia Woolf's fiction, the very short story, <span class="text">An Unwritten Novel</span>.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p> &quot;The narrator, while riding in a train, imagines possible characters and plots for a novel, based on her observations of another passenger whom she calls 'Minnie Marsh.' The narrative alternates between imaginative creation and objective observation, leading the narrator to unexpected discoveries about herself and the nature of art and artistic representation.&quot; <span class="citation"><a href="http://fajardo-acosta.com/worldlit/woolf/unwritten_novel.htm">Fidel Fajardo-Acosta</a></span></p>

<h2><span class="class">Class 36 (Thesis exercise and Peer review of Term Paper) </span><span class="date">due Monday, November 18</span></h2>
<p>The first part of class will be devoted to <em>The Thesis Exercise</em>. Read the <a href="222Thesis exercise.html">web page</a> about how to write a thesis for a literary paper. Print and fill out the <a href="222Theses.html">page of sample FL 222 theses</a> where you rate the examples. The second half of class will be devoted to peer review of the first draft of your <a href="222Paper2010.html">Paper</a>. Print out <strong>two copies</strong> of the <a href="Peerevaluation2.pdf">Peer Review Feedback Form</a> to include with the <strong>two copies</strong> of your draft which you will bring for your classmates. Fill out the top part of the form with your name, paper title, and date. Do <strong>not wait</strong> until the last minute to print these materials out. Email me before class if you have an idea for your own original topic so that I can approve it. Speaking of original, a very creative paper where almost all the main characters meet in Hell written by a former student is featured <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~dsbeckma/To Hell with Literature.htm"> here</a>, and my favorite missing chapter of <em>Candide</em> is <a href="222VoltaireCandide.html">here</a>. </p>
<p>Selected writing advice from the <a href="222Paper2010.html">Term Paper page:</a></p>
<h3>Choose your topic</h3>
<p>Read through the topic choices below. Consult Chapter 10 in <span class="text"> A Short Guide, Writing about Fiction: the World of the Story</span>, especially the pages on &quot;Getting Ideas&quot; (171-5).  Which texts have been your favorite or challenged you the most? Send me an email or make an appointment if you need help deciding on a topic. <span class="red">If you are doing a creative project, you will not have a <strong>thesis </strong>per se in your rough draft, but you will replace that with a <strong>story premise </strong>that explains what the goal of your project is and how it relates to the text(s) you are responding to. </span></p>
<h3>Steps for writing </h3>
<p>Step 1: read, re-read and annotate your texts; write preliminary notes; build up to a fully formulated thesis. A thesis is a clear and specific argument, not a list, not an opinion, not an obvious fact.</p>
<p>See the <a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/course/FL/222">Library Tools</a> page to see resources available to you from NCSU libraries. </p>
<p>Step 2: Following <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>, Chapter 3; write a first draft of 1-2 pages about one of the topics below for the peer review session. It should have a working title and a fully formulated introduction (you can rewrite them later, but they need to be there for the draft) and several finished paragraphs; your audience knows the text, so you should avoid plot summaries. Use the present tense for literary analysis: Ivan <strong>is</strong> an ambitious&hellip; Flaubert <strong>reveals</strong>&hellip; Include your outline. This is the peer review draft version of your paper; print and bring 2 copies of it to class. Include the <a href="Peerevaluation2.pdf">Peer Review Feedback form</a> with each copy.</p>
<p>Some useful pages (among many) about writing:</p>
<ul>
  <li> For the difference between formal and informal style: <a href="http://www.mondofacto.com/study-skills/writing/how-to-use-academic-writing-style/04.html">http://www.mondofacto.com/study-skills/writing/how-to-use-academic-writing-style/04.html</a>.</li>
  <li>For guidelines about  commas, see <a href="http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/commas.html">http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/commas.html</a></li>
  <li>For writing anxiety or writer's block, see <a href="http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/writing_anxiety.html">http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/writing_anxiety.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. Beckman's hint about titles: A dull title sets expectations low. A good title invites the reader! Quotes, proverbs or aphorisms make great titles. Try a google search with a key word from your thesis (pride, satisfaction, quest, etc) and the word quote. I've already got a <a href="222Lovequotes.html">web page</a> with love quotes for you to use, since love is such a popular topic. </p>

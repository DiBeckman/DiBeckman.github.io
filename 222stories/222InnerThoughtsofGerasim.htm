<p align="center">The Inner Thoughts of Gerasim </p>
<p>I had to look after Mr. Ilyich today. Some people may consider my duties a filthy task but it doesn&rsquo;t bother me. I usually have to clean up after his excretions and help him up once he&rsquo;s finished. He&rsquo;s extremely weak from his sickness and seems to have a bit of trouble functioning normally. Seems to me he just needs a little company to help him through the days until he passes on. I can&rsquo;t quite make sense of his sickness but I know it&rsquo;s making him tired and distraught. I can&rsquo;t imagine feeling the way he must feel. I thank God everyday for my health. My father always taught me to take care of others in need for I&rsquo;ll be in their position one day. For this reason, I put forth as much effort as possible with Mr. Ilyich. My father would be proud. I also enjoy the conversation. He&rsquo;s got some interesting things to say although he talks about himself a lot and his work even more. I had always understood Mr. Ilyich to be self absorbed and engulfed in his work. This is usually the main complaint from the servants around the house. Yet, I find when one knows him deeper he truly does have other cares and interesting observations on life. I wonder if being idle so much has led him to new realizations. I&rsquo;m sure he is not enjoying his sickness and finds himself quite bored compared to how occupied he kept himself with his work prior to this sickness. </p>
<p>Mr. Ilyich must be disappointed with his family. They pay him no mind. It&rsquo;s as if this illness was almost welcomed. By this I mean, it seems he was such an encumbrance to them that his absence could in fact be some sort of relief. I know his sickness is tiring for the family yet they seemed to have no stamina for him even when he was well. It leads me to wonder if he truly was a burden while alive. I can imagine Mr. Ilyich must have been a bit difficult to get along with at times. I never noticed many fights between Mr. Ilyich and his wife but then again to think of it I never noticed much conversation at all between the two of them. Perhaps they bored one another. I could not begin to explain their relationship as I haven&rsquo;t been around for enough of it. All I see now is a look of dismay in the family&rsquo;s eyes and an air of impatience. There seems to be little concern or grief. His wife checks in on him from time to time. She looks as him as though he&rsquo;s nothing but a bother. I&rsquo;m wondering if she&rsquo;ll actually mourn when he&rsquo;s gone. </p>
<p>In my observations during my time at the Ilyich house, it has appeared to me he could have been absent during his children&rsquo;s youth and neglectful of his marriage given his focus on his job. At least he&rsquo;s good at what he does. Such a concentration paid off. He&rsquo;s a damn good lawyer. A good man, I&rsquo;d say. He sings my praises for taking care of him but I see no need for it. I&rsquo;m just acting as a good man should. To be honest I&rsquo;m grateful he needs me. It gives me a different sense of usefulness and worth. He gives me a break from chopping wood which I really have to get back to now. All I can say is I like Mr. Ilyich. It&rsquo;ll be a shame to see him go. I only hope to bring him company and some piece of mind during his time left on this earth. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gerasim closed his journal and stood up. He brushed the dirt off his pants and picked up his axe. Gerasim whistled to himself a bit as he continued splitting wood. A small smile spread across his face as need beckoned to him again. He set down his axe and answered Ivan Ilyich&rsquo;s calls. He went into the house and found Mr. Ilyich inside. Gerasim looked at Ivan Ilyich and felt a new emotion: thankfulness. He realized that their relationship was a simple exchange. That more than just taking care of Mr. Ilyich, Mr. Ilyich took care of him. While Ivan needed Gerasim for comfort and company, Gerasim needed Ivan to provide him with a new sense of self.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His relationship with Mr. Ilyich had caused him to remember many fond memories of his childhood. He recalled the day that his grandparents had moved in with his family. He had been excited as a child not realizing the seriousness of his grandfather&rsquo;s condition. Gerasim had been too focused on the joys of having all his family under one roof. It didn&rsquo;t take long for him to understand the situation and why his grandparents had come. His grandmother had always been arthritic and needed help to function but his grandfather had always taken care of her. Now he had tuberculosis and couldn&rsquo;t tend to her as she needed. His father had offered for them to move in and realizing the necessity of it, they accepted. Gerasim remembered his parents never grudged them for all the work and extra means they required of them. His father would always say that aside from needing to be hospitable to everyone in general, parents were even more important. Parents clothe and take care of their children so that one day their children will clothe and take care of them. </p>
<p>It was this idea, this kind heartedness that gave Gerasim such patience dealing with Mr. Ilyich. Gerasim&rsquo;s father had lived a long and respectful life and had died recently also of tuberculosis. While Gerasim tended to his father in his last days he saw many gruesome things as his condition deteriorated. He was never disgusted with Ivan Ilyich for he had seen worse with his father&rsquo;s bloody death. Now only Gerasim and his mother remained. His mother was still quite healthy although aging greatly with each passing day. He found motivation to work for the Ilyichs as much as he could so as to support his mother and himself. Each night when he went home to his mother and told her of his experience with Mr. Ilyich, she would extol his gentle heart and giving manner. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so much like your father,&rdquo; she would say. He would always smile and give a little shrug as though his actions were small. Yet, what may have seemed small to Gerasim was colossal to his dying friend Ivan Ilyich. </p>

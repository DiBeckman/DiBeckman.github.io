<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</b>: 
  Students will be able to...<br>
  <br>
  1. <b>Understand</b> French spoken at normal speed by the teacher, native speakers 
  on the language lab audio tapes when based on previously studied material with 
  approximately 80% accuracy as assessed by ability to answer questions in class 
  and in workbook exercises.<br>
  <br>
  2. <b>Speak</b> French at the Intermediate Level using previously studied grammar 
  and vocabulary with approximately 80% accuracy as assessed by the ability to 
  ask/answer questions, perform skits, discuss readings, participate in oral activities, 
  etc.<br>
  <br>
  3. <b>Read</b> selected French cultural and literary selections at the Intermediate 
  Level with approximately 80% comprehension as assessed by oral/written questions 
  and projects and in-class discussions.<br>
  <br>
  4. <b>Write</b> French at the Intermediate Level using previously learned grammar 
  and vocabulary with approximately 80% accuracy as assessed by written questions, 
  exam questions, etc.<br>
  <br>
  5. <b>Discuss</b> selected aspects of French and Francophone cultures (both 
  high culture and Everyday customs) in English and French based on previously 
  learned material obtained from in-class presentations, videotapes, songs, readings, 
  etc. in French and English.<br>
  <br>
  In order to accomplish these goals, we must use French as the principal language 
  of the classroom. Although most of you will be taking this course as a requirement, 
  foreign language will enhance your career opportunities, whether in the sciences, 
  social sciences, arts, or humanities. Recruiters in business, banking, government, 
  education, the media, and industry are increasingly looking for people with 
  foreign-language abilities. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition to 
  enhancing your professional opportunities, studying French can have other significant 
  benefits. First, it can provide the chance for meaningful travel to France or 
  the Francophone world (Qu&eacute;bec, a number of Caribbean islands, many African 
  countries, Belgium, Switzerland, Tahiti, etc.) Second, in learning about the 
  differences and similarities of another culture, you achieve a new perspective 
  on your own. As Benjamin Franklin--who lived in Paris for several years--once 
  said: &#147;It is only possible to truly understand one&#146;s own country by 
  understanding another.&#148; <br>
  <br>
  <b>PLACEMENT AND PREREQUISITES</b>: Successful completion of FLF 102 at NCSU, 
  transfer credit of its equivalent at another university, or placement into FLF 
  201 on the NCSU Placement Test. The Placement Test can be taken in the <a href="http://fllab.chass.ncsu.edu/">Foreign 
  Language Technology Center</a> (212 Laundry Bldg.). The test will take 20-25 
  minutes and you will receive the results immediately. If you are a student in 
  CHASS and Management, minoring in a language or a French or Spanish major, you 
  must take FLF 201 for a grade rather than Credit Only or Audit.<br>
  </font></p>

  <br>
  Required Textbooks: Valette and Valette, <b><i>&Agrave; Votre Tour</i></b> (D.C. 
  Heath &amp; Co., 1995) and the accompanying <i><b>Workbook</b>.</i><br>
  <br>
  <b>Bring your textbook to class each day</b>; bring the <b>workbook</b> on exam 
  days.<br>
  <br>

  It is YOUR responsibility to keep up with both the workbook and the tape/lab 
  work on your own time. Your performance in the class will show that you have 
  been working with these materials<br>
  <br>
  <b>ATTENDANCE: Required</b>. You are permitted two absences in a class taught 
  Tuesday/ Thursday with no penalty. Each additional absence will reduce your 
  class participation grade by one grade (from A to A-, from B+ to B, etc.). This 
  policy is based on the University attendance policy. Assignments must be turned 
  in on time for full credit. There are no make-up exams unless the absence is 
  due to serious illness, injury, death or illness in the family, university duties, 
  court attendance, or religious observance. Upon return to class after an absence, 
  you are responsible for any homework, quizzes, compositions, etc. assigned for 
  that day. Get the email or IM address of other students in the class, so you 
  can contact someone if you are unsure of an assignment.<br>

  Writing Exercises. You will get 5 points <b>extra credit </b>for complete Listening 
  and Speaking Exercises. There is no Answer Key for these exercises. You may 
  do the lab work at the <a href="http://fllab.chass.ncsu.edu/">Foreign Language 
  Technology Center</a>, at the corner of Stinson and Current Drives. If you prefer 
  to work at home you may have a copy made of the cassette for each chapter, on 
  a good quality, blank 90-minute cassette to the FLTC and ask for tape series 
  1A1. <br>
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>COMPOSITIONS</b>: 
  You will write two double-spaced, word-processed compositions, submitting a 
  first draft and final version for each. Please note: use of on-line translators 
  for writing assignments is not allowed. Learn to type accents on your computer. 
  You will find an explanation of how to do this on the <a href="201supp-04.htm">Supplementary 
  Materials</a> page. <br>
  <br>
  You may submit your compositions to me by email, using a Word attachment. They 
  must be received by the time class starts on the day the composition is due.<br>
  <br>
  First drafts will be returned to you with corrections indicated. A <a href="201CorrectionSymbols.html">Key 
  to the Correction Symbols</a> is posted on the Supplementary Materials page. 
  The final draft of the composition will be graded using the <a href="201Scoringrubric.html">Scoring 
  Rubric for Foreign Languages classes</a>. You must include the rough draft when 
  you turn in your final draft to receive full credit. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Assignments 
  are posted on the <a href="201supp-04.htm">Supplementary Materials</a> page 
  and linked to the <a href="201sylsp04.html">Syllabus</a>.<br>
  <br>
  <b>WRITTEN WORK</b>:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Please 
  skip lines on all written assignments whether handwritten or typed.<br>
  <br>
  DO use regular or online dictionaries to find French or English equivalents 
  for individual words. For example: <br>
  <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/tr">http://babelfish.altavista.com/tr</a><br>
  <a href="http://humanities.uchicago.edu/forms_unrest/FR-ENG.html">http://humanities.uchicago.edu/forms_unrest/FR-ENG.html</a><br>
  <br>
  However, do NOT use online translators for phrases or sentences for written 
  assignments. The results are poor and will violate Academic Integrity (see below).<br>
  <b><br>
  PRESENTATIONS</b>: You will give 3 presentations to the class as indicated on 
  the syllabus: a history presentation based on pages 102-107 in our text, a presentation 
  on a French speaking country (pays francophones), and a music presentation based 
  on pages 176-185 in our text. The presentations will be graded using the <a href="AssessmentGuideOral.html">Assessment 
  Guide for Oral Presentations</a> Note the emphasis on eye contact with the audience 
  and not relying too heavily on notes. The written work you turn in for each 
  presentation will be graded using the <a href="201writingassistance.html">Writing 
  Assistance Rubric</a>. <br>
  <br>
  <b>EXTRA CREDIT</b>: You can earn extra credit towards your participation grade 
  by revising any of your written assignments. Always turn in the first version 
  along with the revision. You may also turn in written work related to our class, 
  such as the translation of a <a href="musique.html">song </a>we have listened 
  to in class or the account of a French meal you have cooked. You may also research 
  a French person or topic related to your major, write about a French film or 
  video you have seen (use the <a href="filmsheet201.html">Film Study Sheet</a>), 
  see a French-related exhibit at the Art Museum, and so on. See me with questions.<br>
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>HONOR 
  CODE</b>: The Foreign Language Department takes the University Policy on Academic 
  Integrity very seriously. If you do not already have the pamphlet explaining 
  this NCSU policy, ask your advisor for one. In accordance with this policy, 
  you will be required to sign the Honor Pledge on every test that you take in 
  this class. The Honor Pledge reads: &quot;I have neither given nor received 
  any unauthorized aid on this test.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  <b>TUTORING</b>: Academic Support Services in Room 147 Leazar Hall (near the 
  Bell Tower) offers free tutoring beginning the third week of the semester. Please 
  see me right away if you are experiencing problems or if reasonable accommodation 
  needs to be made in the case of hearing, visual, motor, or learning disabilities. 
  I'm always available if you need help.<br>
  <br>
  <b>STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES</b>: For all students currently registered with 
  the Office of Disability Services for Students (DSS), an accommodation letter 
  will be sent to the instructor. This letter verifies that appropriate documentation 
  is on file and that the student has a substantiated disability requiring effective 
  reasonable accommodations. Any student requesting accommodations for whom a 
  letter has not been written must see a DSS service provider in Suite 1900, Student 
  Health Center.<br>
  <br>
  Students with disabilities, for whom a letter of accommodation has been sent 
  from the DSS office to the instructor, should schedule an appointment with the 
  instructor immediately. <br>

  <br>
  <b>FRENCH CLUB</b>: Consider joining the French Club to get extra exposure to 
  the language and culture. You are welcome at any of the meetings which take 
  place every other Wednesday at 4 PM in room 143, 1911 Building. I will let you 
  know when the first meeting takes place.<br>

  <br>
  <b>RESPONSIBILITIES</b>: I will do my best to make the class atmosphere creative, 
  lively, and accepting of your best efforts. In turn, you too have some responsibilities....<br>
  <br>
  1) <b>Prepare assignments before coming to class</b> so we can get the most 
  out of our class time together. Assignments are to be completed as indicated 
  on the syllabus. It is nearly impossible to &#147;cram&#148; for this course 
  and do well. Learning a language is like building a house of cards: each one 
  must be well in place before adding the next. I urge you to spend at least 30 
  minutes on French per day, rather than studying all at once before exams. Regular 
  repetition of small quantities of information is the most successful method 
  for learning a foreign language. <br>
  <br>
  2) <b>Participate actively</b> in each lesson. Mentally answer each and every 
  question when a classmate is responding. Class participation and homework make 
  up 25% of your grade. The more you participate, the better your grade will be, 
  and the better your French will become. Your class grade reflects your performance 
  in class (attendance, knowledge of daily lesson, volunteering answers, asking 
  questions, class reflections). It will help to work with the language lab tapes. 
  Play them on your car or home stereo; even if you&#146;re not always actively 
  listening, it will help your proficiency. You will often have to listen to the 
  tapes more than once, so don&#146;t get discouraged if you cannot understand 
  every word the first time. The tape exercises will get easier as the semester 
  progresses, if you make the effort. Take listening comprehension seriously &#151; 
  it will help both your proficiency and your grade (there is a listening component 
  on exams). <br>
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 3) 
  <b>Take risks</b>. Speak out. Don&#146;t be afraid to make mistakes. I am here 
  to help. The more you speak, the more you will get out of the class. <br>
  <br>
  4) <b>Speak French as much as possible</b> in the classroom. To this end, the 
  following expressions will be helpful: <br>
  <font color="#990099">R&eacute;p&eacute;tez, s&#146;il vous pla&icirc;t.</font> 
  Repeat, please <br>
  <font color="#990099">Comment dit-on &#147;....&#148; en fran&ccedil;ais</font>? 
  How do you say &#147;....&#148; in French? <br>
  <font color="#990099">Que veut dire &#147;....&#148;? </font>What does &#147;....&#148; 
  mean? <br>
  <font color="#990099">Qu&#146;est-ce que c&#146;est?</font> What&#146;s that? 
  <br>
  <font color="#990099">Je ne sais pas</font>. I don&#146;t know. <br>
  <font color="#990099">Je ne comprends pas</font>. I don&#146;t understand. <br>
  <font color="#990099">J&#146;ai une question</font>. I have a question. <br>
  <br>
  5) <b>Bring your textbook</b> to class every day. This is essential. You should 
  also purchase a decent quality French/English-English/French dictionary. While 
  not required, it will help you find words not explained in the textbook. <br>
  <br>
  6) <b>Be playful and participate</b> in skits, and conversations. <br>
  <br>
  7) <b>Take notes</b> in class. Buy 3x5 notecards to make personalized verb charts 
  and other study aids. Study together in pairs groups outside of class. <br>
  <br>
  8) <b>Use French outside of class</b>. See French movies in theaters or on video 
  (Blockbuster, North American Video, and the Media Center in D.H. Hill Library 
  have great French film collections). Talk to your roommates and friends in French. 
  Listen to French CDs and visit French web sites. Go to cultural events sponsored 
  by organizations such as the Triangle&#146;s Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise (I will 
  announce these in class). You are also welcome to join the French Club during 
  the academic year, to get extra exposure to the language, and to meet French 
  and Francophone students. You can earn extra credit by turning in commentaries 
  on French-related films, art exhibits, or other cultural experiences.<br>
  <br>
  </font><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My personal 
  teaching philosophy is reflected in this quotation from educator Haim Ginnott 
  (1922-1973):</font></p>
<p> <font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#147;It's my 
  personal approach that creates the climate. It's my daily mood that makes the 
  weather. As a teacher, I possess a tremendous power to make a student's life 
  miserable or joyous. I can be a tool of torture or an instrument of inspiration. 
  I can humiliate or humor, hurt, or heal. In all situations, it is my response 
  that decides whether a crisis will be escalated or deescalated and a student 
  humanized or dehumanized.&#148; </font><br>
  <br>
  <font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I look forward to 
  a pleasant and productive semester! Don't hesitate to ask me for help and assistance

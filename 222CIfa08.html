<p class="style14"><b>COURSE DESCRIPTION</b><br>
  In this course we will explore the Western literary tradition through reading, 
  discussing, and writing about some of the major works of European literature 
  from the eighteenth through twentieth centuries. We will also pay attention 
  to the political and cultural contexts of these works. Students will &quot;engage the human experience through the intepretation of human culture [and] become aware of the act of interpretation itself as a critical form of knowing in the humanities.&quot; (<a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/uap/academic-standards/gep/courselists/humanities/requirement.html">General Education Program</a>, NCSU) <br>
  <br>
  <b>LEARNING GOALS</b><br>
  By the end of the course you should be able to: <br>
&#149; explain the characteristics of the major literary periods of Western 
  Culture from the Enlightenment to Modernism, comparing  &quot;ideas, values, images, cultural artifacts, economic structures, technological developments, [and] attitudes.&quot; (<a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/uap/academic-standards/gep/courselists/humanities/requirement.html">General Education Program</a>, NCSU) <br>
&#149; describe how a literary text reflects its historical context <br>
&#149; identify the literary and rhetorical devices employed in a text, such 
  as genre, point of view, irony, etc., and relate them to the content of the 
  text (See Course <a href="222Glossary.html">Glossary</a>) <br>
&#149; discuss, orally and in writing, selected literary texts of Western Culture 
  from the 18th century to the first half of the 20th century and their continuing 
  aesthetic validity or challenge <br>
&#149; write a coherent essay on given topics about these texts and their contexts, 
  supporting arguments with evidence (quotes) from the literary texts. The learning objective is for students to &quot;make academic arguments about the human experience using reasons and evidence for supporting those reasons that are appropriate to the humanities.&quot; (<a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/uap/academic-standards/gep/courselists/humanities/requirement.html">General Education Program</a>, NCSU). <br>
  <br>
  <b>GRADING<br>
  </b> Your grade in this course will be computed as follows: <br>
  <strong>Class Work</strong>: Attendance &amp; Participation (25%), Homework (65%), Poetry Presentation &amp; Quiz (10%): 20%<br>
  <strong>Discussion Board </strong>or<strong> Reading Notebook</strong> 10%<br>
  <strong>Paper 1</strong>: 15%<br>
  <strong>Paper 2</strong>: 15%<br>
  <strong>Midterm</strong>: 15%<br>
  <strong>Final Exam</strong>: 25%<br>
  <br>
  There will be plus/minus grading in this class. The scale will be as follows:<br>
  A+ = 97.0-100, A = 93.0-96.9, A- = 90.0-92.9, <br>
  B+ = 87.0-89.9, B = 83.0-86.9, B- = 80.0-82.9, <br>
  C+ = 77.0-79.9, C = 73.0-76.9, C- = 70.0-72.9, <br>
  D+ = 67.0-69.9, D = 63.0-66.9, D- = 60.0-62.9, <br>
  F = 59.9 and below.<br>
  <br>
  <b>ATTENDANCE REGULATIONS</b>: Attendance is <b>required</b> and will be taken 
  daily. You are expected to arrive on time to class; repeated tardiness will 
  affect your grade. You are permitted three absences with no penalty. Each additional 
  absence will reduce your class participation grade by one grade (from A to A-, 
  from B+ to B, etc.). See me as soon as possible after an absence and provide 
  a written excuse to be accepted at my discretion (in case of illness, injury, 
  death or illness in the family, university duties, court attendance, or religious 
  observance). Save 
  your absences for emergencies. Excessive absences may lead to an F for the course. This 
  policy is based upon the University Attendance Policy at <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/academic_affairs/pols_regs/REG205.00.4.php">http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/academic_affairs/pols_regs/REG205.00.4.php</a><br>
  <br>
  If you need to miss a class, let me know 
  in person or by email before the class meeting, if possible.  Upon your return 
  to class, you are responsible for all work missed and for any assignments announced during your absence.  <strong>No late work will receive full credit unless an excused absence has been accepted by the instructor.</strong></p>
<p class="style14"><strong>INCOMPLETE GRADES &amp; LATE ASSIGNMENTS</strong><br>
  Incomplete grades will be given only when a student cannot complete the course work due to unforeseeable circumstances beyond his/her control and has done most of the course work. In the case of an excused absence, students need to set up a timetable with me to complete the missing assignments. <br>
  <br>
<b> CLASS WORK: </b></p>
<p class="style14"><strong>HOMEWORK<br>
</strong>There will be informal <span class="style20">daily</span> writing assignments. Writing assignments are  posted  on the <a href="222writingassignmentsfa08.html">Daily Writing Assignment</a> page. They do not appear on the syllabus. You may type or handwrite them. Double space or skip lines, so there is room for comments. Please include an assignment heading (for example, Pope <em>Essay on Man</em> Stanza X, Bovary 4) with your answer. You may also wish to copy and paste the prompt as a heading if you are typing the assignment. </p>
<p class="style14"><strong>ATTENDANCE/ PARTICIPATION</strong><br>
  The attendance/ particpation portion of the Class Work grade will be determined using the following criteria and attendance requirements above.<br>
  <br>
  A = you are well prepared and participate actively; you are attentive, respond 
when called upon and volunteer often with pertinent questions and comments. <br>
  B = you are usually prepared and always respond when called on; you volunteer 
  on occasion. <br>
  C= you show evidence of being unprepared; you have some trouble when called 
  on and do not volunteer often. <br>
  D = you are unprepared and/or inattentive; you never volunteer; you come to 
  class late and/or leave early. <br>
  F= you exhibit a lack of concern for the class; you sleep in class; your behavior 
may have a negative effect on the class</p>
<p class="style14">See below for discussion of the <a href="222poetrypresentation.html">Poetry Presentation</a> and quizzes.</p>
<p class="style14"><b>DISCUSSION BOARD</b>: 
  WebCT Discussions</p>
<p class="style14">To enhance your 
  involvement with our texts, and extend class particpation outside of our limited 
  class time, you will be sharing observations and opinions on a class discussion 
  board. To access WebCT, go to <a href="http://vista.ncsu.edu">http://vista.nscu.edu</a> 
  and log in with your Unity ID and password. Once logged in, you will be brought 
  to your <b>my Courses </b> page. Beneath the Courses header you will find links 
  to the home pages of classes in which you are enrolled that are using WebCT. Click on FL 222. This will take you to the FL 222 home page. </p>
<p class="style14">For your first visit to WebCT Vista, please click on the Student Orientation icon. Read <em>Getting Started with WebCT Vista</em>, Section 1, and T<em>he Discussions Tool</em>, Section 5. Follow the instructions to post a comment or response on a particular topic. </p>
<p class="style14">On the home page, you will also find the Discussion Icon where the various discussion topics are listed. </p>
<p class="style14">For help with WebCT Vista, follow the Help links or call 515-HELP.</p>
<p class="style14">In addition to 
  a first introductory post, you will be required to post at least 7 original 
  contributions (abbreviated as <b>oc </b>on the syllabus) on 7 different authors, each one at 
  least 7 lines long when posted.  You should make at least one good point and provide evidence for your 
  statement, for example, explain your interpretation or support it with a quote 
  from the text. You 
  can also make comparisons with other texts we have studied, make a comment on 
  a general theme (social rules and restrictions, utopia, boundaries), a specific 
  use of language, or invite discussion on a debatable point. In addition, you 
  are required to post 6 responses to contributions by others, on 6  
  authors. Each one must be at least 5 lines long.  Here, too, please support 
  your comment with evidence.  Before you post, please read what has already been written 
  to avoid duplication and a failing grade for that post. For the responses, please 
  comment directly on what has been written by at least one other student. It is fine to post an original contribution and response on the same author. </p>
<p class="style14">Dates by which 
  your introduction, 7 original contributions and 6 responses should be posted are listed on 
  the <a href="222syfa08.html">Syllabus</a>. Since there are more than 17 authors 
  you have flexibility; however, late postings will <b>not </b>count towards your 
  grade. Cutoff is midnight when the date changes. You are responsible for a total of <strong>14 posts</strong>, including your self-introductory post to the class. </p>
<p class="style14">Discussion Board 
  postings will be graded pass/fail. If you pass, you'll get full credit: <strong>10% of your final grade</strong>. If your 
  first post is graded a fail, we will discuss in the 
  office  and you'll have another chance. In order 
  not to get behind on your postings, I recommend that you make at least 3 original 
  contributions and 3 responses by midterm. You may post as often as you like 
  to contribute to the discussion, as long as you remain on topic.</p>
<p class="style14"><b>READING NOTEBOOK</b><br>
  As an alternative to the Discussion Board <span class="style19">or for extra credit <span class="style5">(see below)</span></span>, you may choose 
  to keep a Reading Notebook which will be turned in 4 times over the semester as indicated on the syllabus. 
  I recommend using a  ring binder with tab dividers, but you can organize it your own way as long as you include the information listed below. For example, some students prefer to organize their notebooks chronologically, with Just the Facts, Vocubulary and Lightning for each text all together. Others prefer to keep each section separate. You will be graded on completeness, thoughtfulness, 
  and creativity: see <a href="222Gradingreadingnotebook.html">Notebook Grading 
  Rubric</a>. Print out a copy of the rubric to sign and submit with your Notebook.<br>
  <br>
  Section 1: <b>Just the facts</b>. One page for each work we study. Include title, 
  date, author, original language, main characters and setting, and a one paragraph 
  plot summary. These pages will be extremely helpful when you study for exams.<br>
  <br>
  Section 2: <b>Vocabulary</b>. List of new or unfamiliar words you encounter 
  while reading or hear in class, including literary terms, along with their definitions. Use an online or paper dictionary to look up words you don't know, such as <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="http://www.wordreference.com/">http://www.wordreference.com/</a></font>  (See also Shannon&#146;s Glossary of Literary Terms, pp. 202-208.) You should 
  have entries for each text.<br>
  <br>
  Section 3: <b>Lightning</b>: what struck you while you were reading. <br>
  For example: copy down memorable or provocative passages or images; include 
  your personal response to something you&#146;ve read--what it made you think 
of in your own life. </p>
<p class="style14">Shannon&#146;s 4 questions (p. 27) are also helpful guides:<br>
  What is confusing?<br>
  What is repeated?<br>
  What is familiar?<br>
  What is strange?<br>
  <br>
  Here is an example from a student's homework: &quot;However a strange phrase 
  with I was not familiar was the image of <span class="style21">a rose dying in aromatic pain</span>. To say this expression took my breath away would be clich&eacute;, but it just about did. The way Alexander Pope wrote this phrase made me feel as if I had been shocked by an electric current. The rose, while doing its job, shows no sign of anguish whatsoever. This flower presents itself in a content fashion, not questioning its way of life. It may suggest to us humans to follow its example and go along with the positions to which God has designated us.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  Another idea is to use the web to search for quotes by a particular author and find one that sparks some thoughts in your mind. I typically use Google and type in the author's name and the word quotations. </p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style20">On the grading rubric, you'll notice that I write: <em>After the first submission, response to instructor feedback is 
      included.</em> This means that I expect you to write responses to the some of the comments I write on your notebook pages or homework. The Reading Notebook, like the daily writing assignments, is ideally a dialogue between teacher and student. </span><br>
      <br>
  These notes and comments will be helpful when you participate in class discussion and are 
planning your papers and taking exams. <br>
  <br>
  Section 4: Optional. Class reflections, notes, written work and tests returned, 
  etc.<br>
  <br>
  <b>EXAMS AND QUIZZES</b>: Students prepare assigned reading (see <a href="222syfa08.html">Syllabus</a>) <b>before</b> coming to class. There may be  a pop-quiz during the semester. <br>
  <br>
  There will be a midterm and a final exam. Make-up for exams will be granted 
  only if you are excused <b>in advance</b> with proper documentation. <br>
  <br>
  Exams will consist of:<br>
  1) <strong>Identification</strong> of selected passages. Identify the <font color="#FF0000">author, work, approximate 
        date, and original language</font>. Briefly discuss the passage and 
      its relevance  to the work as a whole with attention to both form and content. <br>
  2) <strong>Short essay</strong> (approx. 300 words) on the <font color="#FF0000">literary movements</font> studied. You will be expected to define and illustrated the movement(s) by referring to authors, works, main ideas, relevant literary terms (satire, autobiography, absurd) and any appropriate social or historical events. <br>
  3) <strong>Long essay</strong> (400-500 words) on a given topic or theme and how it is treated in at least 
      two works we have studied. <br>
      <br>
      <b>PAPERS</b><br>
  In addition to the <a href="222writingassignmentsfa08.html">informal writing assignments</a>, you will submit two papers in draft 
      and final form: the first should be 4-6 pages and the second 5-8 pages. Due 
      dates are listed on the <a href="222syfa08.html">Syllabus</a> and  assignment 
descriptions given in <a href="222Paper1.html">Paper 1</a> and <a href="222Paper2.html">Paper 2</a>.</p>
<p class="style14"> The honor pledge, &#147;I have neither given nor received unauthorized assistance 
    on this assignment&#148;  is included on the Self-evaluation and Reflective Statements which you will turn in with your final draft. You are responsible for printing and filling out the appropriate form for each paper: <a href="Selfevalref.html">Self-Evaluation and Reflective Statement for Paper 1</a>, <a href="Selfevalreffinal.html">Self-Evaluation and Reflective Statement for Paper 2</a> or  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="style9"><a href="Selfevalreffinal-creative.html">Self-Evaluation and Reflection Statement for Creative Rewriting Papers</a>.</span></font></p>
<p class="style14">We will work with Edward A. Shannon&#146;s book to support your writing about 
      literature. You do not need to consult critical literature on the author or 
      the text, but should engage yourself closely with the text, or an aspect of 
      it, and formulate your thoughts about it in a organized way. I am most interested 
      in your own original ideas, not someone else&#146;s, nor in a paraphrase of 
      my comments from class, our class-discussions, or the readings themselves. <br>
      <br>
      If you use ideas or quotes from critical literature (books, articles, internet, 
etc.), you need to document your sources and give proper credit to someone else&#146;s 
      ideas whether you quote directly or rephrase their ideas. Otherwise you 
      violate academic integrity and commit plagiarism (see below for policy). Do not 
      make someone else&#146;s ideas the major focus of your paper. For the format 
      of footnotes and bibliography, if you have them, refer to the MLA Style Manual 
(available in bookstore or library) or Chapter 6 in Shannon. You can also use the NCSU Libraries' <a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/lobo2/citationbuilder/citationbuilder.php">Citation Builder</a>.<br>
<br>
  Papers are due at the beginning of the class period. Email submissions and late 
submissions will only be accepted with my permission. <br>

          <br>
  See <a href="222scoringrubric.html">The Scoring Rubric</a> to see how your paper 
          will be graded and what to strive for in the areas of content, organization 
          and format, grammar, vocabulary and fluency, and supporting documents. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Supporting documents</strong>: We will use a peer review process as well as instructor review to help you improve 
    your writing. See the <a href="PeerReviewFeedback.html">Peer Review Feedback</a> form. Print out and bring two copies of this form for your classmates to fill out for you. You will also fill out a Self-Evaluation form to include along with the Peer Review Feedback forms and first drafts when you turn in your final 
        draft. You will lose points on your paper if these documents are not included. See <a href="222scoringrubric.html">Scoring Rubric</a> for details.<br>

<p class="style14"><b>EXTRA CREDIT<br>
  </b>To earn up to 5 points extra credit on your final grade, you may maintain and submit a Reading Notebook (see 
above) in addition to participating in the online discussions. <br>
<br>
<span class="style15"><span class="style5">You can earn 
extra credit towards your Class Work grade by doing the </span> <a href="Type/ExtraCreditType.html">Extra Credit Assignment on <em>Myers-Briggs Type in College</em></a></span>. This would be a good thing to do the first month of class, so that you and I can get to know one another better. You can also by attending supplementary art or literary activities which relate 
  to our class. To get extra credit, write me something about what you learned or something which impressed you. 
You may also consider using one of the plays or particular art works in your papers. See me with any questions. </p>
<p class="style14"><b>HONOR CODE</b>: 
  The Foreign Language Department takes the University Policy on Academic Integrity 
  very seriously. An atmosphere of trust, honesty and respect for each other fosters 
  educational progress and success. Please do not give me any reason to be suspicious 
  of your honesty. I ask each student  to fill out and return the <a href="AcademicIntegrityPledge.html">FL 222 Academic Integrity Form</a>. Please read it carefully before signing. </p>
<p class="style14"> You are to do your own work on all class assignments, papers, 
  and exams, unless it is a designated   group assignment. You must not incorporate others&#146; ideas or words and present them as your 
  own&#151;this is called plagiarism. Whether you take ideas (verbatim or just 
  as an idea) from books, the internet, or other sources does not matter; you 
  need to acknowledge their source if they are not your own. <span class="style19">Let me warn you especially 
  about the temptations of the internet</span><em>.</em> You will find more details in Shannon, 
  pp. 148-150. <br>

DIVERSITY POLICY:</strong> <br>
This course fosters free and open dialogue, the acceptance and discussion of different opinions, and mutual respect among class members. Please consult <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/campus_environ/non-discrimination/REG04.25.1.php">NCSU Policies on Non-Discrimination</a> . </p>
<p class="style14">Every member of the university community has the right to work and learn in an environment free from discrimination and harassment. Since everyone has this right, everyone also has the responsibility to help prevent discrimination or harassment from occurring. There are some simple ways to prevent discrimination and harassment. One of the most important ways is to respect others and make sure your actions serve as a role model for others. You can also:<br>
  &bull;	Get to know those around you.<br>
  &bull;	Do not talk about topics such as sex, race, ethnicity, or religion on the job or in the classroom unless it is germane to the discussion.<br>
  &bull;	Refrain from using jokes, words, and gestures with sexual, racial, religious, or other discriminatory connotations.<br>
  &bull;	Respect others' personal space.<br>
  &bull;	Avoid making assumptions about others.<br>
  &bull;	As members of a university community, we all have the right to work and learn without being discriminated against or harassed. We also have some responsibilities &mdash; to help prevent discrimination and harassment, and to help address it when it does occur.</p>

  I look forward 
  to a pleasant and productive semester! Don't hesitate to ask me for help or 
  moral support in person or by <a href="mailto:DiBeckman@earthlink.net">email</a>. 
  My personal teaching philosophy is reflected in this quotation from educator 
Haim Ginnott (1922-1973):</p>
<p class="style14"> &#147;It's my 
  personal approach that creates the climate. It's my daily mood that makes the 
  weather. As a teacher, I possess a tremendous power to make a student's life 
  miserable or joyous. I can be a tool of torture or an instrument of inspiration. 
  I can humiliate or humor, hurt, or heal. In all situations, it is my response 
  that decides whether a crisis will be escalated or deescalated and a student 
  humanized or dehumanized.&#148; <br>

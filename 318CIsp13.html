</ul>
<strong>
  Resources available in DH Hill</strong>: Textbooks and films are on reserve at the Circulation desk. I encourage you to watch the films with other students from the class whenever possible. There are many <a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/studyrooms/getaroom.php">rooms</a> you can reserve at the library. 
  <p><strong>Others source for films:</strong> In addition, many films are available to stream online: try Amazon, Netflix, iTunes, Hulu, Hulu Plus, YouTube, etc. Corrigan (132-34) lists other resources.  Hulu Plus has recently purchased the Criterion collection, so you will find many of the most important older films on that site. Please share where you find films online under the Moodle topic &quot;Je l'ai trouv&eacute;.&quot; Information and clips from Singerman's<span class="text"> Apprentissage</span> are available on the book's <a href="http://franklin.davidson.edu/lrc/french/frenchcinema/index.html">website</a>.</p>
<h2>COURSE DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>In this course we will explore the heritage of the French cinema through watching, reading, 
  discussing, and writing about some of the major films 
  from the nineteenth through twenty-first centuries. We will also pay attention 
  to the political and cultural contexts of these works. Students will &quot;engage the human experience through the interpretation of human culture [and] become aware of the act of interpretation itself as a critical form of knowing in the humanities.&quot; (<a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/uap/academic-standards/gep/courselists/humanities/requirement.html">General Education Program</a>, NCSU)</p>
<h2>LEARNING GOALS</h2>
<p>By the end of the course you should be able to:</p><ul>
<li>explain the characteristics of the major periods of French cinema from its invention to the present day comparing  &quot;ideas, values, images, cultural artifacts, economic structures, technological developments, [and] attitudes.&quot; (<a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/uap/academic-standards/gep/courselists/humanities/requirement.html">General Education Program</a>, NCSU)</li>
<li>describe how a film reflects its historical context.</li>
<li>identify the narrative and cinematic devices employed in a film, such 
  as theme, point of view, mise-en sc&egrave;ne, and composition, and relate them to the content of the 
  film. See  Glossaries in <span class="text">Apprentissage </span>(3-7) and <span class="text">A Short Guide </span>(174-177) for definitions of these terms. </li>
<li>discuss, orally and in writing, selected French films and their continuing 
  aesthetic validity or challenge.</li>
<li>write a coherent essay on given topics about these films and their contexts, 
  supporting arguments with evidence. The learning objective is for students to &quot;make academic arguments about the human experience using reasons and evidence for supporting those reasons that are appropriate to the humanities.&quot; (<a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/uap/academic-standards/gep/courselists/humanities/requirement.html">General Education Program</a>, NCSU).</li></ul>
<h2>GRADING</h2>
<p>Your grade in this course will be computed as follows: <br />
  <strong>Class Work</strong>: Attendance &amp; Participation (25%), Homework  (75%):<strong> <span class="red">25%</span></strong><br />
  <strong>Film Presentation  <span class="red">15%</span></strong> <br />
  <strong>Moodle Discussion Board</strong><strong>: <span class="red">15%</span></strong><br />
  <strong>Paper: <span class="red">15%</span></strong><br />
  <strong>Midterm: <span class="red">15%</span></strong><br />
  <strong>Final Exam: <span class="red">15%</span></strong><br /></p>
<p>There will be plus/minus grading in this class. The scale will be as follows:<br />
  A+ = 97.0-100, A = 93.0-96.9, A- = 90.0-92.9, <br />
  B+ = 87.0-89.9, B = 83.0-86.9, B- = 80.0-82.9, <br />
  C+ = 77.0-79.9, C = 73.0-76.9, C- = 70.0-72.9, <br />
  D+ = 67.0-69.9, D = 63.0-66.9, D- = 60.0-62.9, <br />
F = 59.9 and below.</p>
<p>This is an academically rigorous  class with a lot of film viewing outside of class as well as daily writing assignments. I  expect a lot from  students and will do whatever I can to help you succeed. I will do my best to keep the class atmosphere creative, lively, and accepting of your best efforts. Keep up with the work and participate actively in class. Both <strong>effort</strong> and <strong>ability</strong> will be rewarded.</p>
<h2>ATTENDANCE REGULATIONS &amp; LATE ASSIGNMENTS</h2>
<p>Attendance is <strong>required</strong> and will be taken daily. You are expected to arrive on time to class. Repeated tardiness will 
  affect your grade: two tardies will count as one absence. You are permitted one absence with no penalty. Each additional 
  absence will reduce your class participation grade by one step (from A to A-, 
  from B+ to B, etc.). See me as soon as possible after an absence and provide 
  a written excuse to be accepted at my discretion (in case of illness, injury, 
  death or illness in the family, university duties, court attendance, or religious 
  observance). Save 
  your absences for emergencies. <strong>Excessive absences may lead to an F for the course</strong>. </p>
<p>If you need to miss a class, let me know 
  in person or by email before the class meeting, if possible.  Upon your return 
to class, you are responsible for all work missed and for any assignments announced during your absence.  <strong>No late work will receive full credit unless an excused absence has been accepted by the instructor</strong>. These policies are based on Departmental and <a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03">University Attendance Regulations</a>.</p>
<h2>INCOMPLETE GRADES</h2>
<p>Incomplete grades will be given only when a student cannot complete the course work due to unforeseeable circumstances beyond his/her control and has done most of the course work. In the case of an excused absence, students need to set up a timetable with me to complete the missing assignments. </p>
<h2>HOMEWORK</h2>
<p>Students view and write about assigned films (see <a href="318sysp13.html">Syllabus</a>) <strong> before</strong> coming to class. The informal daily writing assignments  are posted  on the <a href="318devoirssp13.html">Les Devoirs</a> page. They do not appear on the Syllabus. You may type or handwrite your daily writing assignment.<strong> Double space or skip lines</strong>, so that I can read them easily and  there will be room for my comments. Please include an assignment heading (for example, <em>Fant&ocirc;mas</em>, <em>La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc</em>). You may also wish to copy and paste the prompt as a heading if you are typing the assignment. If you use a spiral notebook, please remove the little bits of paper on the left-hand edge before turning in your homework. Feel free to use recycled paper. I appreciate legibility and ecological efforts!</p>
<p>  In your daily writing assignments, as on longer papers, be sure to cite your secondary sources. Not citing them can lead to a failing grade on the assignment or in the course. See the section on the <strong>Academic Integrity </strong> below. </p>
<h2>WRITTEN WORK</h2>
<p>Please <strong>skip lines</strong> on all compositions and longer written assignments whether handwritten or typed.</p>
<p> <strong>Do</strong> use regular or online dictionaries to check gender, spelling, and find French 
  or English equivalents for individual words or idiomatic expressions (for example: <em>tourner un film</em> = to make a film). Bookmark these sites:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.wordreference.com/">http://www.wordreference.com/</a> (my favorite; great for idioms)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.oxfordlanguagedictionaries.com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/"> oxfordlanguagedictionaries</a> (Sign-on via NCSU Libraries. Includes useful links and resources including the Dictionary Skills Resource Pack) </li>
  <li>The University of Chicago site has a handy <a href="http://machaut.uchicago.edu/conjugator">French verb conjugator</a></li>
</ul>
<p>However, do <b>NOT</b> use online translators for complete sentences in written 
  assignments. The results are poor and will violate <strong>Academic Integrity</strong> (see below).</p>
<h2>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY</h2> 
<p>The Foreign Language Department takes the University Policy on Academic Integrity 
  very seriously. An atmosphere of trust, honesty and respect  fosters 
  educational progress and success. Please do not give me any reason to be suspicious 
of your honesty. I ask each student  to fill out and return the <a href="AcademicIntegrityPledge.html">FLF 318 Academic Integrity Form</a>. Please read it carefully before signing. </p>
<p> You are expected to do your own work on all class assignments, papers, 
  and exams, unless it is a designated group assignment. You must not incorporate others&#146; ideas or words and present them as your 
  own&#151;this is called plagiarism. Whether you take ideas (verbatim or just 
  as an idea) from books, the internet, or other sources does not matter; you 
  need to acknowledge their source if they are not your own. <strong>Let me warn you especially 
    about the temptations of the internet</strong>. There are appropriate and inappropriate uses of sites such as Wikipedia in this class. Not citing your source is <strong class="red">always</strong> inappropriate, and may result in a failing grade on the assignment or for the course.</p>
 
<p>Violations of academic integrity (plagiarism, cheating, etc.) <strong>will be prosecuted</strong>  according to <a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01">NC State&#146;s Code of Student Conduct</a>. <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/student_services/student_discipline/POL11.35.1.php"></a></p>
<h2>PARTICIPATION</h2>
<p class="red">Cell phones and mobile devices must be silent and put away during class. No texting, please.</p>
<p>The attendance/ participation portion of the Class Work grade will be determined using the following criteria and attendance requirements above. You will also have the opportunity to fill out a self-evaluation of your participation in class. </p>
<p>A = Student comes to class prepared, brings proper materials, and arrives on time. Student is attentive and frequently volunteers to participate. Student is actively involved in all class activities and stays on task in group work. Any questions and comments are pertinent. <br />
  B = Student is  usually prepared. Student is attentive, participates in all activities, and volunteers from time to time. Student asks only pertinent questions. <br />
  C= Student shows evidence of being unprepared and may do homework, consult the newspaper, or text during class. Student may arrive late or leave early. Student volunteers infrequently and may ask questions that would not be necessary had the student prepared for class.<br />
  D = Student is unprepared and/or inattentive. Student rarely volunteers and demonstrates lack of involvement in class activities. Student may not stay on task in group work and may ask unnecessary or inappropriate questions. <br />
  F = Student is disrespectful and exhibits a lack of concern for the class. His or her behavior 
may have a negative effect on the class</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION BOARD: Moodle</h2> 
<p>To enhance your 
  involvement with the films and extend class participation outside of our limited 
  class time, you will be sharing observations and opinions on a class discussion 
  board. To access Moodle, go to <a href="http://moodle.wolfware.ncsu.edu">http://moodle.wolfware.ncsu.edu</a> 
  and log in with your Unity ID and password. Once logged in, you will be brought 
  to your <strong>my Courses </strong> page. Beneath the Courses header you will find links 
to the home pages of classes in which you are enrolled that are using Moodle. Click on FLF 318. This will take you to the FLF 318 home page. </p>
<p>If this is your  first visit to Moodle, you may wish to consult <em>Moodle Student Orientation </em>under <em>Learning with Moodle: A Student's Guide to Using  Moodle</em>. </p>
<p>On the FLF 318 page, you will also find the <em>Discussion des films</em> Topics block where the  topics are listed. </p>
<p >For help with Moodle, follow the Help links or call 515-HELP.</p>
<p>You will be required to post at least 8 original 
  contributions  on 8 different films, each one <em>at 
  least 5 sentences long</em>. You can use  <a href="318Questions.html">Les Questions</a>  or Corrigan's  Screening Report (8-9) to get ideas. You should make at least one good point and provide evidence for your 
  statement. Explain your observation, interpretation and support it with  specific details. For example, you 
  can make comparisons with other films you have seen or we have studied in class or make a comment on 
  a general theme or a specific 
  use of cinematic technique.  Following up your personal observation with a question is a good strategy. The best posts are thought-provoking for the rest of the class. <span class="date"><br />
  <br />
  </span><span class="red">The Moodle Forum is not Rotten Tomatoes. Your reviews should go beyond simply what you like and don't like. The purpose of the class is to get you out of your comfort zone and learn to observe and appreciate why the filmmakers chose to tell the stories they did and what the films reflect about French history and culture.</span></p>
<p>In addition, you 
  are required to post 7 responses to contributions by others, on 7  
  different films. Each response post must be <em>at least 5 sentences long</em>.  Here, too, please support 
  your comment with evidence.  Before you post, please read what has already been written 
  to avoid duplication and a failing grade for that post. In your response, please 
  comment directly on what has been written by another student, mentioning him/her by name or quoting his/her post. It is fine to post an original contribution and response to some one else's post on the same film. Each of these posts will earn you a point towards your final grade. </p>
<p>Posts will be due  at midnight on the Sunday following class discussion of the film. Responses to those original contribution posts are due the following Sunday at midnight. You can check the number of posts you have made on the <em>Forum Posts</em> or <em>Activity Reports</em> tabs on your Participant page in Moodle. </p>
<p>If you submit 15 acceptable posts, you'll get full credit: 15% of your final grade. If your first post is  unacceptable, I will let you know by email, and you'll have another chance. If your posts are too short, you will only receive partial credit and if they are late, you won't receive any credit. <span class="red">In order 
  not to get behind on your postings, I recommend that you make at least 3 original 
  contributions and 3 responses by midterm. You may post as often as you like 
  to contribute to the discussion, as long as you remain on topic. </span></p>
<p> There is a list of American and French Supplementary Films in the right-hand column of the <a href="318sysp13.html">Syllabus</a> that I believe are valuable additions to the required films. I have listed them in connection with the time period being studied that week. On the Moodle page, they are listed with (fs=film suppl&eacute;mentaire) after their title. Beyond those, my husband and I have also made <a href="https://vimeo.com/channels/lille">short films</a>  in France every summer as part of Summer Study Abroad in Lille. Comment on any of those films under the<em> Les Films de Lille sur vimeo</em> heading. You may post on any of these supplementary films  at any time during the semester. These posts will be worth 1/2 point each. </p>
<h2>EXAMS</h2>
<p>There will be a midterm (15% of final grade) and a final exam (15% of final grade) as indicated on the <a href="318sysp13.html">Syllabus</a><a href="222syfa12.html"></a>. Make-up for exams will be granted 
  only if you are excused <strong>in advance</strong> with proper documentation. </p>

<p>Midterm: As part of the midterm (20 points out of 100) you will prepare and turn in your own <em><strong>Glossaire  du cin&eacute;ma</strong></em>. It should include a minimum of 50 terms in French and English and an illustrative example (in words or with an image) from a film you have seen<span class="red"> for 20 of those terms</span>. Here is a <a href="318Glossaire.docx">template</a> to give you an idea. Some useful resources include: Singerman (3-7), Corrigan (174-177), Wikipedia &quot;<a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossaire_du_cin%C3%A9ma">Glossaire du Cin&eacute;ma</a>.&quot; I've also found a series of YouTube videos called &quot;Frame by Frame&quot; very helpful, such as this one on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwEnJRUogYA">Camera Moves</a>. If you find other notable resources, please let me know.</p>
<p>For both exams, I will show you a clip that we have discussed in class as well a short film that we have not and ask you to write about them, using appropriate vocabulary and connections with films seen during the semester. <span class="red">Use the first three sets of questions on the <a href="318Questions.html">Question Page</a> as a prompt for your studying and writing</span>.  <span class="red">The <a href="318FilmScoringRubric.html">Scoring Rubric</a> (for the term project) shows how your papers
  will be graded and what to strive for in the areas of content, organization 
and format, grammar, vocabulary and fluency. I will be looking for the same qualities on the exams, although my expectations are different since the exams are timed.</span></p>
<h2>PRESENTATion AND PRoject</h2>
<p>In addition to  <a href="318devoirssp13.html">Les Devoirs</a>, you will present (alone or with a partner) a French film of your choice (15% of final grade) as well submit  a Term Project (15% of final grade). Due 
  dates are listed on the <a href="318sysp13.html">Syllabus</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Presentations:</strong> The class presentations will be on the last three days of class. Each presentation should be approximately 10 minutes long, including a clip of not more than 5 minutes to share with the class. You will also turn in a <em>fiche pedagogique</em> to the professor. Presentations will be arranged chronologically. To select your film, see the list of recommended films in Singerman (373-77) or the list of <a href="318Must-see.html">Must-see French films</a>. You may also choose another French film that is not on either of these lists. Sign up for your films on a first-come, first served basis by an email to me. You must make your choice by <span class="date">March 25</span>. There will be a 5 point penalty for each day past this deadline. The presentation will be graded by the entire class based on this <a href="318Peereval.html">rubric</a>.</p>
<p>La Structure de la Pr&eacute;sentation</p>
<ul>
  <li>De quel genre de film s'agit-il?</li>
  <li> R&eacute;sumez l'intrigue du film. Expliquez la structure et les th&egrave;mes du film et notez le vocabulaire essentiel ou sp&eacute;cifique au film.</li>
  <li>D&eacute;crivez les personnages principaux.</li>
  <li>Choisissez une sc&egrave;ne et commentez cette sc&egrave;ne et sa technique cin&eacute;matographique.</li>
  <li>Comment est-ce que ce film fait partie de l'h&eacute;ritage du cin&eacute;ma fran&ccedil;ais?</li>
  <li>Qu'est-ce que vous avez appr&eacute;ci&eacute; le plus dans le film?</li>
</ul>
<p> Pr&eacute;parez <strong>une fiche p&eacute;dagogique</strong> pour le professeur avec le titre du film, le r&eacute;alisateur, les personnages et acteurs principaux, notes sur le vocabulaire, la structure, le th&egrave;mes, et les sources consult&eacute;es.</p>
<p>For your final project  you may choose to write a paper in French (6-9 pages) or make your own film in French (5 minutes). You may also choose to work with a partner for the paper or with a group for the film.  For your paper, you may choose to write about the film you present in class or another French film. I am flexible about the precise topic: please choose something that you find compelling. The paper can follow the model of the chapters on each film in Singerman (without the dossier critique), the model of Corrigan's &quot;Critical Essay&quot; (12-14; with sample essays 78-81; 96-102; 150-154), or focus on a particular actor, director, or other film-related topic. The peer review draft of your term project is due <span class="date">April 8</span> and the complete rough draft due on the day of your presentation, <span class="date">April 17-24.</span> The final project will be due <span class="date">Monday, April 29</span>, University Reading Day in the main FLL Office, Withers 310. Late 
  submissions will only be accepted with my permission, and must be arranged before the due date of the paper. Otherwise, you will lose 10 points each day that the assignment is late. <br />
  <br />
  See the <a href="318FilmScoringRubric.html">Scoring Rubric</a> (for the term project) to see how your papers
  will be graded and what to strive for in the areas of content, organization 
and format, grammar, vocabulary and fluency. <span class="text">A Short Guide to Writing About Film </span>Chapters 5-7 includes details about what is expected for style, research and manuscipt form.</p>
<h2>EXTRA CREDIT, SERVCE LEARNING and HONORS CREDIT</h2>
<p> You may also earn 2 points of service-learning extra credit towards your final grade by participating in the <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/gti/gti_students/gti_SKEMAvolunteer.php">GTI</a> International Cultural Leadership Project  for <a href="http://www.skema.edu/en/usa">SKEMA</a>, the new French business school on the NCSU Campus. To become a volunteer, see <a href="http://go.ncsu.edu/ICLP">http://go.ncsu.edu/ICLP</a>.</p>
<p>You can also earn 
extra credit towards your Class Work grade by doing the <a href="Type/ExtraCreditType.html">Extra Credit Assignment on <em>Myers-Briggs Type in College</em></a>. This is due during the first month of class. </p>
<p>In addition, you can  see other French films or attend supplementary art or literary activities which relate 
  to our class. To get extra credit, write me something about what you learned or something which impressed you.</p>
<p class="style14">Students have also approached me about getting honor credit for the class. I am happy to work with you to design a project that will meet those requirements. </p>
<h2>COURSE EVALUATIONS</h2>
<p>Online class evaluations will be available for students to complete in the last few weeks of the semester. Students will receive an email message directing them to a website where they can login using their Unity ID and complete evaluations.  All evaluations are confidential; instructors will never know how any one student responded to any question, and students will never know the ratings for any particular instructors.<br />
  Student help desk: <a href="mailto:classeval@ncsu.edu">classeval@ncsu.edu</a><br />
More information about ClassEval: <a href="http://www2.acs.ncsu.edu/UPA/classeval/">http://www2.acs.ncsu.edu/UPA/classeval/</a></p>
<h2>STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES</h2> <p>For all students currently registered with 
    the  Disability Services for Students (DSO), an accommodation letter 
    will be sent to the instructor. This letter verifies that appropriate documentation 
    is on file and that the student has a substantiated disability requiring effective 
    reasonable accommodations. Any student requesting accommodations for whom a 
    letter has not been written must see a DSO service provider. Students with disabilities, for whom a letter of accommodation has been sent 
  from the DSO office to the instructor, should schedule an appointment with the 
  instructor immediately. </p>
<p>DSO information can be found  at
<a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/dso">http://www.ncsu.edu/dso</a> or call the office directly at 919 515-7653.</p>
<h2>DIVERSITY POLICY</h2>
<p>This course fosters free and open dialogue, the acceptance and discussion of different opinions, and mutual respect among class members. Since class participation is required, it is important that students not be afraid to speak up and share their ideas. If you ever feel that you have been intimidated or treated disrespectfully in class, by me or by another student, please come see me in private as soon as possible. That is not the environment I desire for this class. </p>
<p>Every member of the university community has the right to work and learn in an environment free from discrimination and harassment. Since everyone has this right, everyone also has the responsibility to help prevent discrimination or harassment from occurring.  One of the most important ways is to respect others and make sure your actions serve as a role model for others. You can also:</p><ul>
<li>Get to know those around you.</li>
<li>Our literary texts discuss sensitive topics such as sex, race, ethnicity, and religion. Your observations on these topics should relate to the works we are studying and your responses to them.</li>
<li>Refrain from using jokes, words, and gestures with sexual, racial, religious, or other discriminatory connotations.</li>
<li>Respect others' personal space. </li>
<li>Avoid making assumptions about others. Ask for their opinions and insights.</li>
<li>As members of a university community, we all have the right to work and learn without being discriminated against or harassed. We also have some responsibilities &mdash; to help prevent discrimination and harassment, and to help address it when it does occur.</li></ul>

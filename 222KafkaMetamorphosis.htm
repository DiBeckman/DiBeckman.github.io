<p align="center"><span class="style10">1) </span><span class="style1">The Metamorphosis: A Further Analysis</span><br>
<span class="style2">by Erik Walker</span></p>
<p>Gregor&rsquo;s father agonized with himself as he sulked in his chair in the family&rsquo;s living area. It had been eight months since the death of Gregor. Losing a son had never crossed his mind as he pondered the short life his son had lived. He had always been a man of few emotions and even less compassion. How had he allowed himself to become such a monster and allow no emotion into his life? As Gregor&rsquo;s father contemplated his life, it came to him as quickly as a wolf attacks weakened prey. It was a part of his nature that he never had realized before. He felt for his son for the first time in his life. He didn&rsquo;t feel just for his own loss of his weakened financial state, but he truly felt for the loss of his son. The loss of his son had exuded something completely new to him. This was an emotion that he couldn&rsquo;t describe, an emotion that can be felt by mutual bonds of mankind, but cannot be expressed into words.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Gregor&rsquo;s father struggling with his emotions, Meg entered the room with a silent aura about her that seemed to convey her loneliness. Gregor&rsquo;s father could sense her feelings, he could sense their silent agreement in their lost emotions that they only now began to feel. They had been numb to their surroundings for too long. The numbness ate at their souls as time passed. It was so simple to ignore Gregor when he first transformed, so easy because he doubted Gregor would become what he wanted Gregor to be. Only now after the loss of his son did he realize the feasibility of what he expected of his son. What monster had dwelled inside if him for too long? What worldly shackles had held him for so long to reject his own son?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meg sat down in the chair opposite her father as she soaked in the emotion her father emanated throughout the room. &ldquo;Do you believe Gregor is in a better place?,&rdquo; said Meg as she fiddled with the hem of her dress. Gregor&rsquo;s father simply pulled out his lighter and lit up a cigar. Several minutes of silence saturated the room. Finally Meg ended the awkward silence because of her own insecurity. &ldquo;Do you think what we did to him was wrong?&rdquo; Mr. Samsa solemnly responded in a cautious tone, &ldquo;Perhaps we have damned ourselves through our own inhumane actions, or perhaps we were damned from the start.&rdquo; Mr. Samsa promptly stood up after this epiphany and left the house as Meg began to cry to herself in the living room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Samsa had no idea why he was walking, or where he would end up, but he found himself in front of a pub. Gregor&rsquo;s father entered the pub, and ordered a beer from the aged bartender. As the bartender watched Mr. Samsa drink his beer, he saw a self loathing within Mr. Samsa that he had never seen in his lengthy tenure of bartending. &ldquo;Is there something I can do for you, mate?,&rdquo; inquired the barkeep. &ldquo;Another beer,&rdquo; Mr. Samsa replied, &ldquo;And while your at it, bring me a double whiskey.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Samsa stumbled back to his house barely coherent of his surroundings. While he felt the normal enhanced perception of emotions that alcohol caused, he felt a new emotion that he couldn&rsquo;t remember ever having felt before. Meg was still in the same chair as when he had left her four hours ago. She seemed tired and worn, a look Mr. Samsa had never seen from Meg. As Gregor&rsquo;s father gazed upon Meg, her face appeared to change, to transform. He saw something that at once became familier to him. It was Gregor! Meg had transformed into Gregor! Instantly Mr. Samsa questioned his eyes. &ldquo;Could this be the effect of the alcohol? Perhaps this is simply a mind trick or perhaps I am insane.&rdquo; He at once dismissed what his eyes perceived and went to see his wife. Although when he walked into his bedroom he did not see his wife but instead saw Gregor once again. Mr. Samsa dismissed the sights he saw and blamed the alcohol. Going into the bathroom he splashed cold water on his face and peered into the mirror at his own reflection. As the beads the water dripped off his face, Mr. Samsa was terrified to realize that the reflection in the mirror was not his own, but that of Gregor. As Mr. Samsas sanity slipped away he remembered the brief moments in Gregors childhood that they had spent together in complete and utter happiness. He saw the joy in a childs face and relished it. He again looked at the reflection in his mirror and terror filled his heart as he realized the consequences of his actions against Gregor.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Methodically Mr. Samsa walked towards his closet. Methodically he grabbed his rifle from the top shelf of his closet. Methodically he loaded the bullets into the chamber of his .22 caliber rifle. Methodically he raised the gun to peer through the sights. Methodically he pointed the gun at the beast that should have been his wife. Mr. Samsa then pointed the rifle at himself, and fired. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
Mr. Samsas funeral was brief. His wife and daughter were buried beside him and Gregor. Although Mr. Samsa was dead two days before his wife and daughter, their close relatives only thought it proper to bury the corpses together. Mrs Samsa and Meg had committed suicide several days after Mr. Samsa. Most people theorized it was because of the strange changes in their physical appearance, others thought it was because of the metamorphosis.&nbsp;<br>

  </em>by Scott Sexton</p>
<p class="style9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then, independently of his will, his head sank to the floor and his last breath streamed feebly from his nostrils&rdquo;.&nbsp; The Samsa family left Gregory for dead, locked away in his filth-ridden room.&nbsp; His life, from the moment of his transformation, had proved futile.&nbsp; His family was so shallow that all traces of compassion were thrown out the window as soon as he began to change.&nbsp; He was merely a stain in the family that everyone chose to ignore; they would rather not talk about it.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oddly enough, Meg gained new life with the death of her brother.&nbsp; She was revived and blossomed in his demise.&nbsp; Even before his death, she took control of the family situation and made sure that no one, not even his own parents, set eyes on his decrepit body.&nbsp; He had become inhuman, more of a bug than a man.&nbsp; Not only does Meg appear more beautiful and vibrant than before, but her, and her family&rsquo;s moods get better as well.&nbsp; Each benefits from Gregory&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p class="style9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What they do not realize is that Gregory did not die.&nbsp; His physical appearance might have implied the contrary, but he was merely in a state of suspended animation, a dormancy.&nbsp; When he breathed his last breath, Gregory was actually given a second chance at life; he slowly became human again.&nbsp; Although his body was in a state of living decay during the first metamorphosis, his mind was never affected.&nbsp; Bereft of the power of speech, trapped in a hideous exo-skeleton, his family did not realize was that, mentally, Gregory was completely normal.&nbsp; He was an invalid and could hardly control his movements, but his brain was functioning as it should.</p>
<p class="style9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after Meg locked Gregory away in his room, the entire family left the house.&nbsp; They relished in the new sense of life they had been given.&nbsp; It was as if the weight of the world had been lifted from their backs.&nbsp; No longer did they have to worry about the creature that was Gregory living in their house, locked away in a foul filth ridden room.&nbsp; As they rode the tram into the country, however, Gregory&rsquo;s body was changing yet again.&nbsp; The light shone through a small window in a room covered with feces and the remains of an old, disintegrating bed frame.&nbsp; As the sun rose higher in the afternoon sky, it crept closer and closer to the withered and cracking skin that covered Gregory&rsquo;s body.&nbsp; The door to his room slowly opened as a small puff of fresh air made its way through the apartment.&nbsp; As it hit Gregory, his flaking skin blew away as easily as a dead leaf falls from a dying tree.&nbsp; The skin that crumbled away revealed something miraculous.&nbsp; Under his old scaly shell was the skin of a human.&nbsp; It was soft, and glowed in the light that now shone on his entire body.&nbsp; The light seemed to have a rejuvenating effect on Gregory, as did the wind that was slowly uncovering his new physical appearance: that of a human. </p>
<p class="style9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly, Gregory&rsquo;s eyelids lifted.&nbsp; His vision was blurred and he was confused as to where he was.&nbsp; Bit by bit, he began to piece together what was happening.&nbsp; He remembered what seemed like years ago the argument amongst his family and the boarders.&nbsp; He remembered his sister taking charge when, instead of compelling his parents to care for him, she locked him away in his room to be left for dead.&nbsp; He could see now.&nbsp; It all made sense: the condition of the room, the old exoskeleton that was his skin lay scattered around him, his back was sore.&nbsp; Gregory could now move again.&nbsp; His first movement was a check of his back.&nbsp; The apple was no longer there; he was slowly healing.&nbsp; But what was this?&nbsp; A darkness crept over his vision and his head hit the floor.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gregory awoke some time later, his family still absent from the home.&nbsp; He was now able to fully control his body.&nbsp; He slowly rose from the floor and looked around.&nbsp; He was appalled at the state his room was in.&nbsp; He knew that he had been kept in it for a while, but did not realize the extent of the waste that covered the floor.&nbsp; The stench was unbearable.&nbsp; His first thought was to leave the room.&nbsp; Having regained his mobility, he was able to open the door.&nbsp; The borders, where were they?&nbsp; His last recollection of them was the argument that led to his banishment.&nbsp; He slowly moved about the house, carefully listening for any sign of other people, nothing. The house was as dead as he had seemed to be only hours ago.&nbsp; He moved to the kitchen, he hadn&rsquo;t eaten in weeks.&nbsp; Gregory devoured what was left and had sat down to contemplate what his next actions should be.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left"><span class="style9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Samsa, Mrs. Samsa, and Meg felt like they never had before.&nbsp; They had taken a long walk and were returning to the apartment.&nbsp; They made their way up the stairs to the entrance to their home.&nbsp; Mr. Samsa fumbled with his keys.&nbsp; Inside, Gregory heard the commotion his father was making as he attempted to unlock the door.&nbsp; He swiftly moved to his room and quietly shut the door.&nbsp; The door to the apartment opened.&nbsp; Mr. Samsa was the first inside.&nbsp; He glanced in the kitchen and was shocked at what he saw.&nbsp; Someone had invaded their home.&nbsp; Meg&rsquo;s first reaction was to check her brother&rsquo;s room, but she was not sure why.&nbsp; She instinctively went to his door, expecting it to still be locked tight.&nbsp; She was taken aback when it opened with ease.&nbsp; What she saw was immediately burned into her memory forever.&nbsp; She screamed.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Samsa rushed to their daughter&rsquo;s aide.&nbsp; A body rushed toward them and everything went quiet.&nbsp; Mr. Samsa&rsquo;s last sight was the door to Gregory&rsquo;s room slowly closing.&nbsp; He heard the sound of the cold steel locking him away just before the pungent smell of the room burned his nostrils as his last breath slowly flowed out of his body.</span></p>

<p align="center" class="style2">3 ) <em>Preface to &ldquo;Metamorphosis&rdquo;</em><br>
  by Dan Nowicki</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His dreams were far from easy.&nbsp; But it was not a dream.&nbsp; Gregory Samsa went through a very strange and unfortunate transformation, which would dreadfully lead to his demise.&nbsp; But why did this happen to Gregory?&nbsp; He was in no way deserving of such unwanted change.&nbsp; He had been a workhorse, laboring to relieve the debts of his seemingly helpless family.&nbsp; They were capable of supporting themselves, but they did not.&nbsp; They chose time and time again to rely on young Gregory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seemed to be no explanation for this sudden transfiguration.&nbsp; A human, and a son, transformed to a bug, vermin.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a beautiful, sunny day; a day comparable to typical paradise weather.&nbsp; It was warm, sunny, but with a soft, cool breeze.&nbsp; Gregory had no desire to work.&nbsp; He had nothing, but relaxation on his mind.&nbsp; He snuck out of work early.&nbsp; There is no telling how he got past his boss.&nbsp; This was one feat, but getting out the door of the building was a bigger feat.&nbsp; Winston was a co-worker who never liked Gregory.&nbsp; The reasoning was uncertain because Gregory was sure he hadn&rsquo;t done anything to trouble their relations.&nbsp; Still, Gregory was to make sure he would dodge sight of Winston or such workers who could not but keeps a secret.&nbsp; The only way for Gregory to escape was to rush to the exit door and flee the grounds without looking back.&nbsp; He knew there would be some are to hear the door creak out and slam shut, but if he fled quick enough it was his only chance of circumventing trouble.&nbsp; Would they notice his absence?&nbsp; Of course not.&nbsp; No one cared much for Gregory.&nbsp; Who would check on him throughout the day?&nbsp; Not one person, other than his boss.&nbsp; He, however, only came to see Gregory in the morning before his boss actually started what little work he did.&nbsp; Even if someone came to check on him, Gregory did not care.&nbsp; He wanted freedom.&nbsp; He wanted a better life.&nbsp; This, however, was the last thing in his future.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gregory reached the noisy train station just as paradise turned into its opposite.&nbsp; Dark, gray clouds stormed through the vast skies.&nbsp; With the clouds, came rain.&nbsp; When the rain came, the streets cleared, but Gregory remained.&nbsp; He meandered through the streets expecting to be alone.&nbsp; Unbeknownst to him, he wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Before he could even see it coming, it happened.&nbsp; Who or what it was was a mystery.&nbsp; A pain, and then Gregory was unconscious.&nbsp; He was just like a corpse lying on the ground, never to stand again. Sometime he would live again, but never would he be able to stand upright again.&nbsp; Some men hurriedly concealed Gregory in a large box and left the area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were an unknown agency. Governmental or not, this was an agency which looked to do nothing but harm.&nbsp; They took from others the resources they knew would benefit themselves.&nbsp; Gregory had no recollection where he was taken, for he had only been conscious for a few moments before the agency officials opened his box.&nbsp; They brought him inside the building as the rained poured down in sheets.&nbsp; Gregory was weak, both mentally and physically.&nbsp; He was dazed, barely comprehending what was happening around him.&nbsp; He looked unconcerned with what was transposing.&nbsp; The lightning and thunder which flashed and crashed above had no effect on Gregory.&nbsp; He was motionless as he was carried into the musty, cool building.&nbsp; It was an old wine cellar, hidden beneath ground level.&nbsp; There was no wine in this cellar anymore.&nbsp; Gregory quickly noted the empty racks and felt the cool damp chill of the room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gregory had spent much time in deep thought in recent times.&nbsp; His life was in no way anything near to what he had planned it to be.&nbsp; But was he willing to throw this life away for another one?&nbsp; Could he let go of the blood and flesh that created him?&nbsp; A life on his own was very tempting, but Gregory was strong.&nbsp; So strong he couldn&rsquo;t be forced into it. Tortured, beaten, and emotionally torn, Gregory did not give in.&nbsp; Giving them no choice, the agency men had only one choice.&nbsp; One of the three agency men nodded his head to the lone man in the corner of the room.&nbsp; The man in the corner stood up.&nbsp; He had no reply; he just nodded back.&nbsp; He reached down and grabbed his black briefcase and slowly walked toward the table where Gregory was sitting.&nbsp; He put the briefcase on the table and unlocked the latches.&nbsp; The agency officials left, except for one.&nbsp; The official that remained strapped Gregory down, and followed the others.&nbsp; The lone man from the corner opened his briefcase.&nbsp; Gregory could not turn far enough to see the inside of the briefcase because he was restrained by the straps.&nbsp; He began to worry, almost in a panicking way.&nbsp; He could hear the man fumbling with objects in the briefcase, but Gregory had no clues about what would become of him.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gregory opened his eyes after closing them for an unknown amount of time.&nbsp; When his eyes opened the man was standing in front of him with an object in his hand.&nbsp; Gregory, who hadn&rsquo;t fully awakened from his short slumber, could not make out the object.&nbsp; Gregory quickly noticed bugs crawling all over the table.&nbsp; Soon, they were crawling on Gregory.&nbsp; He began to panic again.&nbsp; Not a second or two later, did he feel a pinch on his arm.&nbsp; A moment later, he was unconscious once again.</p>

4) <em>Trapped in the Closet</em><br>
by Kandis Kelly</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style5">&nbsp; What happened to me?&rsquo; he thought. That was no dream. He sits up in his bed and looks outside. &ldquo;The sun is about to set. I have missed work for today. How will I explain this to my family&hellip;or even worse my boss at the office?&rdquo; Gregory heard movement around his house and he could not come up with an explanation as to why his family would allow him to oversleep for work. As he lay there in bed, he couldn&rsquo;t help but think of the strange dream that he had had that night before. It was so strange. He had dreamed that he was some kind of beetle and his family had made him an outcast. He laughed to himself &ldquo;There is no way that it could have been true. My family is so kind and they love me.&rdquo; He rose from his bed to stretch because his back was intense painful, and then he opened the door to his room. He walked out into the living area and suddenly there was silence. He saw three men that he didn&rsquo;t recognize seated on the couch. Neither the three strangers, his father, mother, or sister looked his way or opened their mouths. The silence was heavy.</span></p>
<p class="style5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gregory then went into the kitchen to get some food but for some reason he didn&rsquo;t have an appetite. The pain in his back was growing more intense even more. Gregory went to his room and began to look for something, but he had no idea what he was looking for. He looked on his shelf, in his drawers and under his bed. For some reason, this terrified Gregory. He began to panic. He looked around his room and for the first time realized how dirty it was. There was broken glass on the floor and his things had been thrown across the room like there had been some kind of struggle.</p>
<p class="style5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was now overwhelmed with anxiety. He didn&rsquo;t know why, but he knew that there was something wrong. &ldquo;What am I looking for?!?!?!? I have to find it before anyone else sees it!!! Where is it?&rdquo; Gregory thought frantically. He went back to the living area with a distraught look on his face. He saw a suit case sitting beside his father&rsquo;s chair. He looked his mother in her eyes and screamed &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; She looked down at the floor. He didn&rsquo;t understand why his family would treat him like this. &ldquo;I know they love me. They are good, caring people, so why are they acting this way towards me?&rdquo; Gregory wondered. </p>
<p class="style5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the table in front of him, he finally found what he was looking for. There it was and he couldn&rsquo;t believe his eyes. A tear formed in his eye and he couldn&rsquo;t figure out whether it was because of his back or because what he saw. Suddenly it hit him. Everything came together.</p>
<p class="style5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His dream was no dream at all. Late that past night while Gregory was sleeping, his father came into his room looking through his shelves for money. While doing this he came across the picture that his son had always made sure to keep secret from his family. The photograph portrayed an intimate moment between Gregory and another man. The man looked a lot like the man that he worked for, his boss. His father then showed the picture to wife and daughter, not knowing that the lodgers that lived with them had over heard the conversation and refused to pay or live with a homosexual. The disgusted father then went back into Gregory&rsquo;s room and pulled him out of the bed. Terrified, Gregory woke up and said &ldquo;WHAT&rsquo;S WRONG FATHER!!&rdquo; but there was never any answer. Gregory&rsquo;s father punched him in the stomach and kicked him in the face until it was almost impossible to recognize exactly who he was. He screamed obscene names at his son and spit in his face. He then took a metal hammer from his tool box and beat Gregory in the back with it. This made a knot about the size of an apple immediately appear on his back. After his father had gotten too tired to beat him anymore, Gregory crawled to his mirror. He couldn&rsquo;t believe his eyes. He had no idea what was looking back at him in the mirror. It was something that so ugly that he couldn&rsquo;t even make a name for it, but it looked like the most disgusting insect that he had ever seen in his life. He burst into tears when he realized that it was his own reflection that he was viewing.</p>
<p class="style5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gregory had been in love with his boss for years now. His boss was the first thing that was on his mind in the mornings when he woke up but he knew that this love was unacceptable. Tears were streaming down his face now. His father without even looking at him pointed to the suitcase and said &ldquo;Here is your bag; leave my house.&rdquo; Gregory knew that this would be exile to his fate if anyone were to discover his secret. He left his father&rsquo;s house without another word. As far as his family was concerned, he was dead, and a burden was lifted from them.</p>

<p align="center" class="style10">5) <span class="style1">Another Metamorphosis</span><br>
by Sarah Wicklund</p>
<p>Meg Samsa woke early one morning to find herself changed into a monstrous vermin.&nbsp; As she lay in bed, she looked down at her strange new body in astonishment.&nbsp; She had a long, but wide body with thin legs.&nbsp; Her skin had an unfamiliar texture to it.&nbsp; Meg panicked, and did not know what she was thinking or feeling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why did this happen to me, too? And how?&rdquo;&nbsp; What would her parents think?&nbsp; How would they react to another freakish change in their only remaining child?&nbsp; Once she calmed down, she began to think of how Gregory might have felt.&nbsp; Of course, she felt nothing like Gregory, she did not possess Gregory&rsquo;s selflessness.&nbsp; He lived completely for his family, whereas, she lived for herself first, and her parents next.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Samsa&rsquo;s were finally living a new life without the burden of taking care of Gregory.&nbsp; Meg had found a smaller flat for her family.&nbsp; It was a quaint little home with two bedrooms.&nbsp; The bedrooms are off of a cozy sitting area that also connects to the kitchen with a single door.&nbsp; Mr. Samsa had a successful new job, and Mrs. Samsa had settled into the new house and enjoyed working on her knitting.&nbsp; Meg had been going on quite a few dates, but had been spending a lot of time with a man named Felix.&nbsp; It had been a few months since Gregory took his last breath.&nbsp; But now the past felt close indeed.&nbsp; And Meg&rsquo;s parents would have to deal with Meg&rsquo;s metamorphosis. </p>
<p>Meg panicked again when she tried to move.&nbsp; She was inexperienced with moving around in a body like hers.&nbsp; She rolled around on the bed for while then pulled herself together mentally and physically.&nbsp; Meg knew that she just needed to grow accustomed to her legs and long body.&nbsp; If Gregory could do it, so could she.&nbsp; Meg looked at the clock and realized that one of her parents would be coming to make sure she was awake and getting ready for work.&nbsp; The thought of trying to go to the shop for work had never even crossed her mind.&nbsp; She could only think that she would live the rest of her life in this bizarre form.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Meg&rsquo;s father knocked on her door to make sure she was awake.&nbsp; Once again Meg panicked; she started yelling at him not to come in her room.&nbsp; Meg told him she was very ill and asked him to write a letter to her boss for her.&nbsp; Then she remembered that she was supposed to go on a date with Felix tonight.&nbsp; Meg knew he would never understand, he knew nothing of Gregory and she intended on keeping it that way.&nbsp; As she called out to her father to write a letter to Felix as well, she noticed her voice sounded different.&nbsp; She hoped her parents would not notice this change.&nbsp; She spent the rest of the day trying to figure out how she could get herself out of this mess.&nbsp;&nbsp; Meg was hoping that tomorrow when she woke up she would be herself again, human again.&nbsp; She crawled around her room, trying to pace as she thought about the possible reasons her metamorphosis.&nbsp; But as the day went on, she felt hunger pains creeping upon her.&nbsp; After many frustrating attempts to open the door, she finally managed to succeed.&nbsp; Meg poked her head out and looked around the sitting room and saw her mother knitting in the corner.&nbsp; Meg decided to make a run for the kitchen, and successfully made it without her mother noticing.&nbsp; Meg rummaged around the kitchen and looked for food.&nbsp; She spotted some fruit sitting on the counter, so she tried to jump up a few times.&nbsp; She managed to knock a piece of fruit on the ground and began nibbling.&nbsp; While Meg was in the kitchen her father came home and her mother noticed that her door was open and that she was not in her room.&nbsp; They both went into the kitchen and jumped at the sight their daughter, then fell to the floor unconscious.&nbsp; Meg&rsquo;s father picked up the closest thing to him, some fresh vegetables, and started throwing them at the creature that was Meg.&nbsp; She received quite a few blows to the head and a few pokes in the eye.&nbsp; She scurried back to her room, and then her parents locked her there.&nbsp; They could not believe that this had happen to them again.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Through her door she could hear Mrs. Samsa&rsquo;s sobs.&nbsp; Meg tried to call out to her, but her voice was distorted.&nbsp; All that come out was moans and growling noises.&nbsp; She climbed up onto her bed and tried to curl herself in a ball.&nbsp; She cried herself to sleep that night.&nbsp; </p>
<p>While Meg was sleeping, she dreamt of Gregory.&nbsp;&nbsp; In her dream she was still in the form of this creature, but Gregory was human again. &nbsp;They were sitting in their old flat staring at each other.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are no longer Meg. You are <em>it</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tears rolled out of Meg&rsquo;s eye as she began to realize the heartache Gregory experienced, especially when the family ignored him.&nbsp; She looked deep in his eyes then closed her own and mumbled an apology.&nbsp; Gregory nodded, put his hand on Meg&rsquo;s head and walked out of the room.&nbsp; When she opened her eyes, she awoke to sunlight shinning through her room as she lay curled up on her bed just like she was when she fell asleep the night before.&nbsp; Only now, she was herself, human again.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="style9">Young Meg Samsa was drifting into a long welcomed sleep allowing her to forget the troubles which had entrenched her family of late.&nbsp; Her sleep was quickly interrupted by intense nightmares of her father&rsquo;s accident.&nbsp; She quickly rose from her bed, flushed, and head straight for the kitchen to fetch a glass of water.&nbsp; As her glass was filling up she remembered moments when life was easy, and there was Gregory.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  &lsquo;How wonderful Christmas time was when Gregory was still around,&rsquo; she thought.&nbsp; His charisma would ease the tension which has now become ever so present since both her mother and father were rendered handicapped.&nbsp; Her father had lost both his hearing and eyesight in a horrific train explosion one evening on his way home from work.&nbsp; He had made it all the way home from the accident, using his hands the whole time like they were giant antennae.&nbsp; The doctors said that due to his close proximity to the blast, minor brain damage may also keep him from being able to speak.&nbsp; The doctors were right about their predictions, but what they didn&rsquo;t anticipate was the stress this accident would put on Meg&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp; Mrs. Samsa had made the executive decision that since her salary was less than Meg&rsquo;s, she would stay home and look after him.&nbsp; In order to make up for the lost income Mrs. Samsa decided it was best to pick up an extra tenant, someone who would not mind sharing a room with Meg or providing their own meals just as long as the rent was reasonable.&nbsp; Being the house keeper of a man in such a disabled condition, Mrs. Samsa found it increasingly difficult to find time to clean the &lsquo;forever, dirty house&rsquo; and in her struggle she suffered a stroke.&nbsp; The severity of her stroke rendered her bedridden in an almost vegetative state.&nbsp; She just lay on her back, unable to speak or even think, however when she was hungry she would kick both her arms and legs straight up in the air as if she was trying to walk on the ceiling.&nbsp;<br> 
  <br>
  &lsquo;How nice it was when Papa and Mama would dance to my violin playing on Christmas Eve&rsquo; Meg thought.&nbsp; It was true.&nbsp; Even Gregory would pull out pots and pans and attempt, unsuccessfully to keep rhythm.&nbsp; Meg&rsquo;s pleasant thoughts of christmas&rsquo;s past erased any prior dread of going back to sleep for fear of those recurring nightmares.&nbsp; She drifted back down the hall and fell quickly back to sleep.<br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  She awoke to the sounds of pots and pans in the kitchen and the putrid smell of the Rod&rsquo;s cooking.&nbsp; She had been too slow to make it to the kitchen to see what it was he was putting in his breakfast mush, but she was sure it had long since spoiled.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  &lsquo;Good morning to you Ms. Samsa,&rsquo; Rod said, attempting to look bigger and more interesting than he really was.&nbsp; Rod was a tall, thin man with brown hair and a moderately handsome composition.&nbsp; He would have been considered indisputably attractive by all who knew him if it had not been for his large nose and two very big, yellow front teeth.&nbsp; Rod was the perfect tenant because his garbage collection salary would not allow him to find a better place to live, and even if it would, he was so madly in love with Ms. Samsa that he secretly vowed he would rather live on the streets than anywhere else without her. <br>
  <br>
  &lsquo;Oh, Good morning Mr. Dent,&rsquo; replied Meg.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are you making enough of that fine smelling dish for everybody?&rsquo;&nbsp; Ms. Samsa was not unaware of Rod&rsquo;s unkempt attraction for her and even though she knew her father and brother would disapprove had they been able to inspect him close enough, he did provide a certain security she had come to rely on since her family&rsquo;s troubles.&nbsp; His willingness to help out around the house also proved invaluable and allowed her to work part time as a seamstress.&nbsp; <br>
  &lsquo;No ma&rsquo;m, not this morning, but I would certainly love to cook you dinner tonight.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you let me?&rsquo; he squeaked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Our Christmas bonus came early this year and I would really love to do something nice for you.&rsquo;&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  &lsquo;Well Mr. Dent, I&rsquo;ll let you cook me dinner tonight only on the condition that you let me do the dishes.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been doing so much around her lately that I am starting to feel completely indebted to you.&rsquo;&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  &lsquo;Wonderful, we shall have to go to the store early today, you know they&rsquo;re all closing up for the holidays, but we shan&rsquo;t have to get too much.&nbsp; I believe I already have most of what we need left over.&rsquo;&nbsp; Rod fidgets with the pan his breakfast is in, attempting to prevent it from burning while trying keep it warm.&nbsp; He does not want to divert any attention he has to from young Ms. Samsa.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  &lsquo;That sounds great, I&rsquo;ll go tidy up and do my hair and then we can leave.&rsquo;&nbsp; Meg leaves the room a little uneasy as to what she may have gotten herself into, but pleased at the prospect of a free meal.&nbsp; In a few quick tugs and pulls, Meg reemerges from her room as beautiful as she was before she went in.&nbsp; Why is Rod leaving my parent&rsquo;s room, her brain starts?<br>
  <br>
  &lsquo;What were you doing in there?&rsquo; Meg releases in a tone of strict inquiry, trying avoid showing her true feelings.<br>
  <br>
  &lsquo;I was just sniffing out the situation.&nbsp; I heard some commotion in here so I came to check them out.&nbsp; Your mother would like a glass of water and your father, it seems, would like a cigar.&rsquo;<br>
  <br>
  &lsquo;What?&nbsp; But Father hasn&rsquo;t smoked for seven years.&nbsp; How can you tell?&rsquo;<br>
  <br>
  &lsquo;Its body language,&rsquo; Rod said in a tone as if trying to show the superiority of this form of communication over others.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go fetch him the matches out of the cupboard and bring your mother a glass of water.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be waiting for you outside if you&rsquo;re ready to go.&rsquo;<br>
  <br>
  Ms. Samsa gave her father the matches, kissed her mother and helped the glass to her mouth.&nbsp; To her astonishment her father lit the cigar with out trouble and began billowing out a cloud.&nbsp; Meg made sure she placed her father&rsquo;s hand on the ash tray before leaving the room and turned as she reached the door.&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t help tear up at the crinkled look on her mothers face and the absolute indifference on her father&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She dried her eyes and made for the door not wanting to leave Rod waiting.&nbsp; No more than four seconds after Meg had left the room did her father drop his cigar.&nbsp; It landed gently on Mrs. Samsa&rsquo;s pillow and slowly began to smolder.&nbsp; Mrs. Samsa called out furiously in vain for water, but to no avail.&nbsp; It was too late, all was lost.<br>
  <br>
  Three months later Meg awoke alone underneath a bridge on Crippled Creek.&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t stop the guilt from rushing in.&nbsp; &lsquo;How could I have been so stupid&rsquo; she thought.&nbsp; How has life turned me into such a creature?&nbsp; The garbage from the nearby landfill penetrated her nostrils replacing her thoughts with memories of her brother.&nbsp; It must have run in the family she thought, I have become just like him.</p>
<p align="center"><strong class="style10">7) The Truth from a Dream<br>
  <span class="style10">by</span></strong><span class="style10"> Ashley Schwartzman</span></p>
<p align="left"><br>
  &ldquo;Then independently of his will, his head sank to the floor and his last breath streamed feebly from his nostrils&rdquo; (Kafka, 1996). <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  At that moment he woke up. Gregory was lying in his bed drenched in a cold sweat; sheets tangled and twisted and some on the floor. He was still struggling in his bed when he realized he had been dreaming all along. With his eyes looking contently up at the dark ceiling, he quickly felt his entire body with his hands to make sure he was indeed human once again. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  &lsquo;Could it all have been a dream?&rsquo; he thought. The room was still dark and filled with the shadows his furniture and suitcase of samples created with low light. His gaze turned to the picture of the woman in the feathered hat, just where he had left it, and he felt comforted. He looked around the room and saw that his bed, his desk and his couch were still exactly where they should be. Not a stick of furniture was out of place. He looked at the clock which read half past three in the morning. He still had a half hour before his alarm was scheduled to go off for work. His heart was still racing when he tried to remember everything that had happened in his dream. He could not shake the incredibly sick feeling he felt in his stomach when he thought about how his family had treated him in his dream. Would they really lock him in a room? Would his dear sister really wish him dead? How could his father wound him so and not feel any guilt? Was he that unimportant?<br>
  <br>
  Perhaps falling back to sleep for the half hour he had left before the alarm woke him would clear his mind and ease his thoughts. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  The moment Gregory closed his eyes the alarm clock rang four o&rsquo;clock--It was time to get up. He took his time getting ready this morning--last nights dream felt so real that he was actually thankful for the ability to stand on two sturdy legs, instead of the thin legs that belonged to the bug, and put on real human pants. He buttoned his shirt with more care than usual because he was comforted at the sight of his torso and not the disgusting belly of the bug he was just hours ago in his dream. It was six o&rsquo;clock when he walked into the dining room where breakfast was ready. His mother walked in from the kitchen still wearing her night robe carrying a glass and pitcher filled with orange juice. &lsquo;Good morning Gregory&rsquo; his mother said, her eyes never meeting his. &lsquo;Seems it is raining outside, you&rsquo;d better bring your rain coat and hat with you.&rsquo; Gregory could not help but to feel betrayed by his mother. It was nothing she had done nor anything she had said, in fact it was fueled only by last night&rsquo;s image of his mother not being able to bring herself to feed her own son. Gregory looked at his mother, who had been looking at him for some kind of response, and nodded. How could she be so calm and carefree? What did she do all day while Gregory was at work, and why could she not work herself? After asking himself these questions Gregory became uneasy and angry. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  &lsquo;What do you do with your day Mother?&rsquo; Gregory waited for a response that seemed as though was never coming. After his mother had contemplated the answer she spoke, &lsquo;You know what I do all day. I clean the house and make dinner. I do what every good woman does, and I do what my asthma allows.&rsquo; Unsatisfied with this answer but feeling some ease come to his unsettled mind, Gregory dropped the conversation, finished eating breakfast and left the house without another word. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  While on the train to work, Gregory started to wonder how he ended up living the life he led. He was perfectly aware of the fact that his father had a debt to pay off but he did not know what this debt was or where it came from--why couldn&rsquo;t his Father pay it off himself? His father was not too old to put in a day&rsquo;s work. Gregory spent the entire day wondering why he was the only one in the family who worked. If there was such a debt to be paid, why was the burden only on his shoulders? He also tried to remember a time when any member of the family had thanked him for the life he was sacrificing to support them. He could not think of a single instance when that had happened. Gregory&rsquo;s feeling of betrayal soon turned to anger. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 
  As Gregory was walking up the stone steps to his house he could hear Meg playing her violin. At first the music seemed sweet as warmth touched his heart, but by the time he reached the final step to the door that warmth had turned to cold. The sound of the violin reminded Gregory of a part of his dream he had forgotten until that very moment. The vision that came to Gregory was of course that of Meg playing for the three boarders after dinner. The very thought of that chapter of his dream left Gregory almost paralyzed from betrayal. Gregory had only wanted to listen to Meg play and appreciated her for the talent she possessed, but he had been turned away and worse, wished dead when discovered listening. He loved his sister, he wanted to send her to the best schools to further her musical talent--how could she have treated him so coldly? The more he thought on the matter, the more the sound of her music disgusted him. <br>
  <br>
  Gregory reluctantly opened the door to a house that sent bile into his stomach. He did not understand why his dream was affecting him so. Gregory knew dreams were not real; they were fantasies in the night that drifted away come morning, never to be seen again. But how could a dream so vivid and full of raw emotion not be real? Last night when the bug was hurt, he was hurt; when Meg broke the bug&rsquo;s heart, his heart broke as well; when the apple was thrown at the bug, it was thrown at him. &lsquo;Perhaps dreams are the only way for the mind to see clearly. With no other distractions during the night, perhaps the mind is free to explore the inner perceptions that the dreamer, when awake, cannot&rsquo; Gregory thought.&nbsp; Coming to this conclusion Gregory began remembering instances in his life where he felt he was mistreated or under appreciated. His memory was long and the contempt he was feeling for his family grew. He had indeed been blind to his family&rsquo;s abuse before last night, but was now seeing things clearly for the first time. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  Meg playing her violin in the living room was the first image Gregory saw when he walked through the door. Seeing Gregory for the first time that day, Meg stopped playing mid-song and smiled excitedly at her brother. How wonderful it must be to feel so light and carefree-- as though not a thing in the world matters more than it is allowed. &lsquo;I have been working on this song all day and nearly have it played perfectly. Listen and tell me what you think&rsquo; said Meg. Normally this request would have been entertained and Gregory would have delayed the moment of euphoria he would receive by sitting down on his couch in his room, taking off his shoes, and reading the news paper that his father had previously read that morning, a moment of which he had been looking forward to all day. However, Gregory saw this situation differently today. Why had she not asked him how is day had been, or if she could get him anything from the kitchen? Just as Gregory was about to decline the concert and go upstairs to be at ease in solitude, Meg began to play. Meg&rsquo;s inconsideration sparked a flame of anger in Gregory and motivated him to yell above the music, &ldquo;STOP!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Startled, Meg jumped in her seat and nearly knocked over her music stand. Without a word Gregory turned around and walked into his room locking the door behind him. He could no longer feel peace when Meg played her violin. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  Plagued by the events he had dreamt last night, Gregory could barely bring himself to the dinner table. His mind was clouded and his emotions were exhausted. Perhaps dinner would prove him wrong. There was still a chance that he would be shown love and appreciation from his family in such a great amount that would leave him doubtless of their true feelings towards him. However, when he saw that his family had started eating dinner before he had even reached the table, Gregory nearly screamed from anger and wept from sadness. Keeping his composure, Gregory sat down and ate what little his appetite would allow. The dinner conversation did not pertain to him, and when he tried to include himself, he was ignored. Before Gregory left the dinner table that evening, he announced his plans to move out within the week. &lsquo;You cannot leave!&rsquo; proclaimed his father. &lsquo;What will we do for money?&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp; Gregory replied, &lsquo;That is your burden now, not mine. I am sure you three will be able to find jobs to support yourselves. Perhaps with the extra space, you can rent out the room to two or three boarders. Whatever you choose is of your own concern. I am leaving.&rdquo;</p>

9.  Alternate ending to <em>Metamorphosis<br>
</em>by<br>

</p>
<p>Page 1995 beginning of first paragraph. (Editor's note: italics indicates Kafka's text) </p>
<p><em>&lsquo;We must somehow get rid of it,&rsquo; said Gregor&rsquo;s sister, now addressing only her father because </em>her mother had just recently exited the room, <em>&lsquo;or it will be the death of you both, I can see it coming.&nbsp; When people have to work as hard as we do they cannot take this everlasting worry at home as well.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t either.&rsquo;&nbsp; And she burst into such floods or tears that they splashed down onto her</em> father&rsquo;s <em>face, from which she wiped them with perfunctory movements of her hands.</em><br>
  <br>
    <em>&lsquo;But my child,&rsquo; said her father pityingly and with evident understanding, &lsquo;what are we to do?&rsquo;</em><br>
    <br>
  <em>Gregor&rsquo;s sister merely shrugged her shoulders in token of the perplexity that had come over her with her tears, contrasting with her earlier assurance.</em><br>
  <br>
  <em>&lsquo;If he understood what we said,&rsquo; Gregor&rsquo;s father began half wonderingly, but his sister, still weeping, waved a hand violently to show that it was out of the question. </em><br>
  <br>
  <em>&lsquo;If he understood what we said,&rsquo; Gregor&rsquo;s father repeated as, by closing his eyes, he took in the girl&rsquo;s conviction that was impossible, &lsquo;we might perhaps be able to come to an arrangement with him.&nbsp; But as things are&hellip;&rsquo;</em><br>
  <br>
  <em>&lsquo;It has to go,&rsquo; his sister cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the only way, Father.&nbsp; You must just try to get out of the habit of thinking it&rsquo;s Gregor.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s been our undoing, in fact, that we&rsquo;ve believed it for so long.&nbsp; But how can it be Gregor?&nbsp; If it were he would long ago have seen the impossibility of people living in the same house as such an animal and would have gone away of his own accord.&nbsp; In which case we would have no brother but could at least go on living and could honor his memory.&nbsp; As it is, the brute persecutes us, drives away the lodgers, and clearly means to take over the whole flat and have us sleeping out on the street.&nbsp; Look, Father,&rsquo; she screamed suddenly, &lsquo;there he goes again!&rsquo;&nbsp; And in a state of panic dashed behind her father, who then, prompted purely by her reaction, also stood up and half raised his arms in front of the girl as though to protect her.</em>&nbsp; As it crawled closer, Gregor&rsquo;s father took hold of the chair beside him and raised it above his head.&nbsp; In a state of confusion and fear, it continued to scurry towards them.&nbsp; Gregor&rsquo;s father brought down the chair in a rapid shattering motion, piercing the scaly flesh of the beast&rsquo;s back.&nbsp; The creature let out a long inhuman screech, echoing its undeniable pain and suffering.&nbsp; Its body lay still.&nbsp; Slowly, it raised its head and stared at them with heartbreaking, unsuspecting eyes.&nbsp; <em>Its head sank to the floor and its last breath streamed feebly from its nostrils.</em>&nbsp; &lsquo;Not like this...&rsquo; Gregor&rsquo;s sister muttered through her tears in a soft low voice as she collapsed to her knees in front of the carcass.&nbsp; Gregor&rsquo;s father, paralyzed with guilt, let the chair fall to his side.&nbsp; The sound of its impact on the hard, wooden floor did not break his gaze on the pitiful corpse before him.&nbsp; Suddenly a once familiar voice shattered the imposing silence, &lsquo;Father, what have you done?&rsquo;&nbsp; With chills traversing his body, Gregor&rsquo;s father followed the sound to the pale, broken form of his son slumped in the doorway.&nbsp; Gregor slowly slid down the door frame toward the floor.&nbsp; Tears began to run down his ghost-like face. &lsquo;It was mother&hellip;&rsquo;<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gregor&rsquo;s father stumbled over to the sink heaving putrid bile.&nbsp; Slowly he slid down to the floor, drooling vomit, unable to control the tears that flooded from his eyes.&nbsp; Grete, crawled over to Gregor.&nbsp; They held one another, in mutual agony and grief, each trying to console the other.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, after the tears had passed, Gregor&rsquo;s father walked out of the house to the dilapidated shed where he removed a shovel.&nbsp; There, in the back yard in the dark of night, he began to dig in the cold, falling rain.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Grete helped her brother down the hallway to her bedroom where she lay him in the bed and began to dress his wounds.&nbsp; <em>Admittedly he hurt all over, but he had the impression that the pains were gradually becoming fainter and fainter and would eventually go away</em> altogether.&nbsp; <em>The rotten apple in his back and the inflamed area around it were now completely covered with a soft dust.</em>&nbsp; Grete gently cleaned away the refuse from around the wound, and bit by bit pulled the decayed fruit from his injury.&nbsp; After she had washed and dressed his damaged body she tried to talk to Gregor but was unable to find the words.&nbsp; She reached under the bed and pulled out her violin and began to pull the bow across the strings.&nbsp; She played as though she was reading a well written solo, all her feeling, all her pain, all her sorrow poured out through the heartbreaking notes of her song.&nbsp; As Gregor listened, he knew that this song was his sister&rsquo;s apology, and to him it was the best gift she could have ever given him and a tear ran down his pale face.&nbsp; He laid there, listening to the most beautiful music he had ever heard his sister play, and drifted off into a dream, where he imagined his sister walking through the conservatory hall, her violin under her arm, continuing to play her beautiful music.&nbsp;&nbsp; As her bow made its final draw, her eyes clouded up with tears, and she hugged Gregor and she spoke.<br>
  <br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Gregor, I never meant to be so unkind to you.&rsquo;&nbsp; And she continued to hold her brothers lifeless body.<br>
  <br>
  A couple hours later she heard the back door open.&nbsp; Peering down the hall, Grete saw her father, wet and covered in filth; wrap the creature, once his wife, in a quilt which belonged on the bed they shared together.&nbsp; In a state of melancholy, he picked up the rolled blanket containing the lifeless corpse and staggered out the door.&nbsp; Grete couldn&rsquo;t help but cry as she watched the depressing scene.&nbsp; She returned to her bedroom to continue grieving for her brother.&nbsp; She fell asleep sitting beside the bed. <br>
  <br>
The sound of a crash awoke her from her slumber, she exited the room and walked towards the kitchen where she saw her father; his body, still in motion, swung like a pendulum at the end of a rope&hellip;</p>
<p align="center" class="style13">10. <em>Now What?</em><br>
Dawn Gregory</p>
<p><span class="style11"><em>&lsquo;Now what?&rsquo; Gregory asked himself as he looked about him in the darkness.&nbsp; He quite soon discovered that he could no longer move at all.&nbsp; He was not surprised; in fact what struck him as unnatural was that he had actually been able to get about until then on such thin legs.&nbsp; Otherwise he felt comparatively comfortable.&nbsp; Admittedly he hurt all over, but he had the impression that the pains were gradually becoming fainter and fainter and would eventually go away.&nbsp; The rotten apple in his back and the inflamed area around it, now completely covered with a soft dust, were not forgotten.</em>&nbsp; He recalled his family with revulsion and hate.&nbsp; Thoughts began to run through his head of his sister and mother removing the furniture from his room.&nbsp; He questioned the right they had to empty his room of his belongings.&nbsp; An overwhelming feeling of anger streamed through his blood, as he remembered clinging fiercely to the picture on his wall.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="style11">He was heartbroken, then, as he looked the shattered picture frame on the floor.&nbsp; His sister had come into the room the night before, trying to take away the only thing that reminded Gregory of his human life.&nbsp; He had become angry and rushed towards her, just as she was lifting the picture from the wall.&nbsp; Gregory was furious about the situation he was in and thought of how his family had only made it more difficult for him.&nbsp; They insisted he remain locked up in this filthy room, without furniture and without delectable food.&nbsp; He devised a plan to escape from the room to punish his family, especially his sister, for locking him away and forcing him to lie in his filth and excrement.&nbsp; He remained in this state of hostility until the church clock struck three in the morning.</p>
<p class="style11">When the cleaning-woman arrived in the early morning&mdash;out of sheer, bustling energy she slammed all the doors, no matter how often she had been asked not to, so hard that throughout the flat, from the moment of her arrival onwards, the slamming of the doors and then the brisk reopening as the latches missed, made peaceful sleep an impossibility<em>.&nbsp; She noticed nothing out of the ordinary about Gregory at first as she opened the door and peered in</em>.&nbsp; She thought he was deliberately lying still, trying to trick her so he could escape.&nbsp; She took her long handled broom and gave Gregory a quick push.&nbsp; After trying again, Gregory still did not move.&nbsp; The cleaning-woman ran out of the room and up the stairs.&nbsp; She shouted to the family, <em>&lsquo;Take a look at this&mdash;the thing&rsquo;s snuffed it!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s lying here dead as a doornail!&rsquo;</em></p>
<p class="style11">Gregory&rsquo;s father and mother, awakened from their sleep, rushed down the hall to the room where Gregory was lying lifeless.&nbsp; Gregory&rsquo;s mother, still not being able to enter Gregory&rsquo;s room, motioned for his father to check on Gregory.&nbsp; She had decided that Gregory was no longer her son, yet she still could not bring herself to look at him.&nbsp; As Gregory&rsquo;s father entered the doorway, Meg came rushing in, shouting, &lsquo;No father, let me do it!&nbsp; He became my responsibility and I will take care of him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Gregory&rsquo;s father hesitantly stepped aside to let Meg pass.&nbsp; Meg entered into the room, and knelt down beside the lifeless bug.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear Gregory, I am so sorry all of this had to happen to you.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style11">Meg stretched out her arm to the place of Gregory&rsquo;s back where the rotten apple lay wedged.&nbsp; Just as her arm passed over his body, Gregory jumped up, with all of the energy he could muster, spun around, and bit Meg on the leg.&nbsp; Meg shrieked, and struggled to pull her self up from the floor.&nbsp; Gregory&rsquo;s father grabbed the broom from the cleaning-woman and jabbed Gregory&rsquo;s wounded back until his breathing ceased.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style11">Months passed and Meg&rsquo;s condition continued to worsen every day.&nbsp; She was not able to get out of bed, and she had lost one of her legs from the revengeful bite from Gregory.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Samsa consulted doctors from all over the country but no one could help her.&nbsp; Six month&rsquo;s after Gregory&rsquo;s death, Meg died.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Samsa shed a few tears and then they decided to spend the day resting and going for a walk.&nbsp; The contemplated what they were going to do about their debt, and who they could get to repay it for them.&nbsp; As they discussed these things, Mr. and Mrs. Samsa were struck almost simultaneously by the realization that their life of comfort and ease was forever over.</p>
<p align="center" class="style2">11.<em> Guilt Trip</em><br>
by Cody Mabe </p>
<p><br>
  <span class="style9">Relief is the only word to describe the look on Gregory's face upon awakening with the bright sunlight shining through the window onto his bed.  The church clock began to ring its loud chimes revealing that it was eleven o&iacute;clock in the morning and that he had missed work, but he regarded this small detail with an insouciant attitude.  He was solely relieved that his horrible nightmare was not a reality and that he had not transformed into a giant pest that his family understandably despised.  The bed seemed to be more comfortable than he remembered.  While laying down and looking straight up, he startlingly noticed that his ceiling was painted a different color than he remembered.  It was light brown with swirly brushstrokes, as opposed to the all white ceiling he&euml;s looked up at every morning of his life. <br>
  &quot;When did my ceiling get repainted?&quot; Gregory wondered.  He sat up and suddenly a look of surprise swept across his face.  &quot;Why am I sleeping in my mother and father's bed?&quot;&iacute;  Even stranger for Gregory was that he could not remember falling asleep last night.  Gregory was completely bewildered by his inability to remember his past night's activities, as he didn't recall ever having had these symptoms of what seemed to be short term amnesia. <br>
  <br>
  Instead of laying in bed all day contemplating why he couldn&iacute;t contemplate, he decided that it would probably be a good idea to get out of his parents bed before being discovered there.  While he was exiting the room, the phone rang and Gregory quickly darted to pick it up as he assumed it was probably his boss calling to check up on him after not showing up for work.  It was.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Good morning boss&quot; said Gregory.  A brief moment of silence followed.  Gregory's boss confusingly replied, &quot;Good morning Mr. Samsa.  I am just calling to say that I am deeply saddened after hearing the news of your son Gregory's death, and I have sent a bouquet of lilies in memory of him.&quot;  Gregory was speechless.  He didn't know what to say, so instead he just hung up the phone.  Confused by what he had just heard, he decided to go to the bathroom and run some hot water over his face.  As soon as he entered the bathroom, his heart sunk.  He stood pale and emotionless, looking into the mirror at his own father&euml;s face.  Gregory had been transformed into his father.  Immediately he thought, &quot;This is a nightmare come true.&quot;  As soon as this thought entered his mind, he fell to the floor, and laid there motionless.<br>
  &quot;Heelllllooooo? is anybody home?&quot;  Shouted Gregory's mother.  She and Gregory's sister had gone to the farmers market and upon returning, woke him from his temporary paralysis on the bathroom floor.  Groggily, Gregory&iacute;s father arose from the bathroom floor and entered into the kitchen.  &quot;Good morning my loved ones,&quot; he reluctantly said to his wife and daughter.  &quot;How did the shopping go?&quot; He asked them.  His wife bubbly replied to him: &quot;It went as expected, and we made sure to get your favorite kind of oatmeal.&quot;  He proudly said to her, &quot;I wouldn&iacute;t expect any less from you my dear.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="style9"> One year later, Meg and her mother are arriving home from their short rendezvous in New York City where Meg had auditioned and won 1st chair violin, position for the prestigious New York symphony.  Upon entering the door, they knew that something was wrong.  The door was unlocked and they both knew that they had double checked to make sure it was locked before leaving to go on their trip.  Mr. Samsa had left for a business trip a few days before their vacation and was not expected back for another two days, so they were afraid.  Megs mother said to her, &igrave;Stand right here, and be quiet.  I&iacute;m going to check and see if anyone is in the house.&icirc;  The first place she went to look was in her bedroom.  She slowly opened the bedroom door, and then suddenly she let out a loud, mournful SCREAM!!! <br>
  <br>
  After hearing her mother's scream, Meg ran to the bedroom to see what the problem was.  Laying on the bed was her dead father.  His skin was the color of a blueberry, and his eyes were wide open.  Insanely enough, his pupils were pointing in the exact opposite direction of each other, almost as if each one had a mind of its own.  On his bedside table, the book &igrave;Madame Bovary&icirc; was sitting, opened to the page of Emma&euml;s suicide scene.  His mouth was gaped wide open, and there seemed to be something inside.  Inside of his mouth was an apple covered with insect slime that he had shoved as far down his throat as he could, in order to make his death as quick as possible.  His position on the bed showed no signs of struggle, and all that he left was a simple note which stated: &quot;Won't be back later, went out on a guilt trip.&quot;<br>
  <br>
You see, after Gregory had died, Gregory's father had a major nervous breakdown due to the large amount of guilt and remorse that he felt for the mental and physical torment that he showed towards his only son, which were undeniable factors leading to Gregory's death.  The breakdown was so intense that he developed a major psychological disorder.  The disorder was called the Dissociative Identity Disorder, and he was only affected by it when he was by himself.  On top of this disorder, he also experienced reoccurring nightmares about the death of Gregory in which he experienced the dreams from a first person point of view.  No one knew of his disorder besides a few minor speculations made by relatives and close friends, and no one ever found out.</p>

<p><em><br>
  They had the carriage to themselves, and it was full of warmth and sunlight.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; This feeling of contentment lasted with the Samsas as they made their way back to their flat in the city, which they had decided to sell in favor of less expensive accommodations.&nbsp; On arriving back at home, Mr Samsa noticed that Gregory&rsquo;s room was still in a state of disrepair.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps I will wait a few more days until I give her the notice&rsquo; said Mr Samsa, referring to the cleaning-woman.&nbsp; &lsquo;Just until she has taken care of that mess.&rsquo;&nbsp; He briefly imagined the gigantic bug crawling around the room, but quickly closed the door and removed the image from his mind.&nbsp; He told himself that his son had died long ago with the birth of that creature, and that mourning over such a thing was ridiculous.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 
Mr Samsa returned to the living room where Meg was practicing her violin as Mrs Samsa sat knitting lingerie for an apparently large lady.&nbsp; &lsquo;What do you ladies say to a game of cards&rsquo; suggested Mr Samsa.&nbsp; &lsquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t work very well with only three people&rsquo; replied Meg, looking somewhat irritated that her playing had been interrupted.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; agreed Mrs Samsa, &lsquo;a game would be much better with a fourth player.&rsquo;&nbsp; The silence that followed was evidence that all of them were thinking about Gregory.&nbsp; Not the disgusting, multi-legged version of the young man of course, but the Gregory they remembered with fondness.&nbsp; The Gregory who would, undoubtedly, be available to be their fourth party in a game of cards, seeing as how the only time he left the flat was to go to work.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
 Meg missed her brother.&nbsp; After Gregory&rsquo;s change she often thought about the times they had spent together.&nbsp; Gregory had once tried to teach her how to make a business sale.&nbsp; He had told her that she was a natural salesperson, but she knew she would never be able to do it as well as Gregory.&nbsp; Come to think of it, Gregory rarely talked about anything other than work.&nbsp; He must have enjoyed it a great deal to have been so absorbed in it like that.&nbsp; Meg had once asked him if there was anything else he would like to be, as far as work was concerned, besides a traveling salesman.&nbsp; He told her that at one time he had wanted to be a doctor, but that he was perfectly content with being a salesman. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I would do if I had to change&rsquo; he had said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I could change now.&rsquo;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 
If Meg was truly honest with herself, she even missed having the creature around.&nbsp; Even though it was a gigantic burden, it still represented some form of what had been her brother.&nbsp; The bug still was her brother.&nbsp; She regretted the way she had treated Gregory after the metamorphosis.&nbsp; She had often felt disgusted toward him, wishing this curse had been placed on someone other than herself.&nbsp; She treated him like an animal.&nbsp; She kept his body alive by feeding him, but at the same time she was killing his soul with every cold, wordless visit to Gregory&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; At first she had tried to take care of him, but eventually she left that responsibility up to the cleaning-woman.&nbsp; She initially believed that her brother would get better.&nbsp; Maybe if she took good care of him he would wake up the next morning and be perfectly normal.&nbsp; But morning after morning, month after month, nothing had changed.&nbsp; Gregory had not gotten better.&nbsp; As her hope for Gregory&rsquo;s recovery disintegrated, so had her caring attitude toward him.&nbsp; &lsquo;If I had only kept caring for him,&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;maybe he would have recovered.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&lsquo;Play something for us&rsquo; Meg heard her father say.&nbsp; She did not even realize that she had stopped playing her violin.&nbsp; She looked at the score and began to draw the bow along the strings, releasing sweet notes that created a melody which resonated throughout the room.&nbsp; Mr Samsa recognized the piece as the one Meg had been playing the night before when Gregory had caused such a commotion with the lodgers.&nbsp; It was quite understandable, of course, that they had demanded an explanation.&nbsp; It was not a common occurrence to see a human-sized bug anywhere, much less inside of a proper house.&nbsp; If Gregory had been his normal self, the three bearded men would have undoubtedly enjoyed talking to him.&nbsp; Gregory would have told them about the places he had been to make sales.&nbsp; &lsquo;What a fine young man he had been&rsquo; thought Mr Samsa.&nbsp; &lsquo;He may have gone on to do great things had he not been so overwhelmed by his work.&rsquo;&nbsp; That job had to be the reason all of this had happened.&nbsp; &lsquo;They made him work too hard and too much.&nbsp; That boss of his never gave Gregory any time to do the things that he enjoyed.&nbsp; If it weren&rsquo;t for him, Gregory would still be here now&rsquo; Mr Samsa thought.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Mrs Samsa reminisced about her son as she listened to the song her daughter was constructing.&nbsp; She was relieved to have the creature gone, but with the bug&rsquo;s absence came the final realization that Gregory was truly gone also.&nbsp; He had been a good son.&nbsp; He did so much for the family.&nbsp; He had provided a steady income that the family would no longer have.&nbsp; &lsquo;What if we start to run out of money&rsquo; thought Mrs Samsa.&nbsp; &lsquo;We might not be able to make it without that money Gregory was bringing in.&rsquo;&nbsp; Though she would miss the extra income, she missed Gregory even more.&nbsp; The family was not the same without him.&nbsp; There were so many things she would have said and done differently if she had another chance.&nbsp; &lsquo;Gregory is gone now&rsquo; she told herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I am still a mother.&nbsp; I still have Meg.&rsquo;&nbsp; She wouldn&rsquo;t make the same mistakes with her daughter that she had made with her son.&nbsp; Things would be different with her relationship with Meg.<br>
<br>
As Meg finished her song she wished that Gregory were there to compliment her.&nbsp; He was always her biggest fan.&nbsp; If Gregory were here now she would apologize to him, whether he could understand her or not, for the neglect she showed him.&nbsp; If only she could go back in time and relive that whole twisted part of her family&rsquo;s life over again.&nbsp; Things would be different.&nbsp; She would be different.<br>

  by Austin Caldwell</span><br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" class="style14"> Gregor gathered in his last breath, and then slowly drifted into the darkness. Barely visible in the corner of Gregor&rsquo;s room sat a lunar calendar, and on this day it was the new moon. The lack of moonlight left the city, and Gregor&rsquo;s room in almost total darkness.&nbsp; Gregor peered out from under his covers on this cold night, and pessimistically looked towards his clock. The time read two o&rsquo;clock, and Gregor struggled to understand what had just occurred. Unlike any other night, the events that had just occurred felt so real that it was impossible it was a dream. &ldquo;Could it have only been a dream?&rdquo; Gregor crackled, his throat dry. A few moments before, he felt death was upon him, and now he was clearly sitting in his bed alive. He threw off the covers and stared inquisitively over his body. Gregor counted, &ldquo;Two arms&hellip; two legs&rdquo; as he slid out of bed and walked up to the window, catching a glimpse of his reflection. Before him was the same tired face he had seen upon retiring for the night after a long days&rsquo; work. Relieved, Gregor returned to his bed, the warmth still contained by the covers. <br>
  <br>
  Seconds turned into minutes, and minutes into hours, and Gregor could not fall back to sleep. He lay staring at the ceiling recalling his dream. Outside his window, a gray haze that signaled the start of another day was starting to appear over the horizon. On this day Gregor was not so sad to start his routine and get to his work. The repetitive ringing, which shook all the furniture in his room, signaled his rise from the bed, and the start of another day. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  Gregor made his way to his door, slowly slid the lock, which had cause so much trouble in the dream, opened it, and made his way to the bathroom. He went through his normal routine preparing for work. It was not a little after four and he needed to catch the first train. He slowly consumed his breakfast, for which he had no appetite, and bundled up before leaving the house. He walked through the station, past the office boy, who took count of the employees for the boss, and onto the train. Slowly the cars started rolling, little by little picking up pace. As the train settled into to a rhythmic sway and hum, Gregor would usually doze off to sleep, however not on this day. His mind was somewhere else, thinking about the events of his dream and what it all meant.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&ldquo;It was so obvious, and yet I never noticed,&rdquo; remarked Gregor, while thinking about his family. His whole life, Gregor felt the pressure to support them. His mind poured over all the early mornings, and long days spent working this job that he disliked so much. He suddenly felt that the purpose of his life drain away. &ldquo;How could they turn on me?&rdquo; Gregor muttered as the train continued on. His father, who owed so much to Gregor, turned on him as soon as he could no longer make money. His own father had even attacked him and been the cause of his death. He now realized how hopeless his father&rsquo;s life was. There was no way back for his father.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Gregor&rsquo;s attention turned to a young lady and her mother in a quiet conversation a few rows ahead of him. She was young, and quite attractive. From what he could see, and hear, as she talked loudly and with great speed, she was anxiously discussing her plans and dreams with her mother. Gregor saw in her the face of Grete. She had once shown such a bright future. She was skilled and passionate about the violin. There wasn&rsquo;t a sound more beautiful, he thought, than the sound of her playing from the other room. He had taken a passion in his younger sister and her love for the violin. She had so much future ahead of her, and Gregor wanted badly to make an impact on it. He worked hard in hopes that he may one day be able to send her off to the conservatory. &ldquo;And this is how she repays me&rdquo; he thought. Although she had been kind and caring to Gregor at first, when the others hadn&rsquo;t, all he could think about was her last few words. &ldquo; <em>The brute persecutes us, drives away the lodgers, and clearly means to take over the whole flat and have us sleeping out on the street.</em> (Kafka, p. 1995)&rdquo; This memory hurt Gregor deep, and he no longer could think of his sister with a smile on his face. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  The train slowly came to a stop; Gregory went on with his day drearily and without purpose. He lacked motivation all morning, and any appetite at lunch. The afternoon was more of the same, and he found himself dreading having to go home and interact with this false image of a caring family. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  The whistle blew loudly, and the train slowly crept away from the station in the direction that it had come from. Exhausted from his day, Gregor laid his head against the shaking window, attempting to get some rest before he arrived home. This time he slowly slipped into a calming sleep. At first a light sleep, the noise bouncing around the car slipping into his head, but then he fell into a deep dream. He saw his mother and his father standing welcoming him to a nice house in the countryside. Grete sat by the fire; her hands played the most beautiful music he had ever heard. He was welcomed home as if he had been away for a long time. Their good spirits leaped off their faces; never had he seen a happier sight. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
A screech woke Gregor up suddenly, and he found it to be that of the train slowing into the station. He groggily progressed with the masses and began the cold walk towards home. He attempted to make sense of his latest vision. &ldquo;It was a sign, it must have been!&rdquo; Gregor&rsquo;s heart warmed, he felt alive again as he walked into the cold dark neighborhood. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  He climbed the snowy stairs and peered into the gently lit home. There sat his family, but they did not appear with the same happy faces as he had seen in his dream. They sat anxiously awaiting Gregor for dinner, however there was little food on the table. There was no beautiful violin music playing either. The house sat quiet and still.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Gregor finished his dinner and retired to his room early. He closed the door and placed his hand on the lock. He stood still, starring at the lock, envisioning his dream. Quietly the doorknob turned, and the door was left open. A warm feeling overcame Gregor as he slipped into bed for a nights rest. He lay staring at the same ceiling, as that morning. He saw the spring come, and warm into summer. He saw the leaves turn and the snow start to fall. Then he saw his happy family in a new cozy home, full of beautiful music. &ldquo;A new purpose&rdquo; Gregor thought. </p>

<p align="left" class="style15"><br>
  After the death of her brother, Meg has gained the spotlight in the family with her purity and beauty.  Gregory&rsquo;s sister believes she is ready to take advantage of the situation.  By this time, approximately two months later, the father and mother are beginning to mourn insincerely, as they blame themselves for Gregory&rsquo;s death.  The father hesitantly admits that he did not work hard to provide a good life for his family and that we put unnecessary stress on his son.  Remembering the past events, Mr. Samsa contradicts his previous statement, &lsquo;that can&rsquo;t be the reason for Gregory&rsquo;s death; I put the boy to the test and he has failed.  That boy needs to work harder and do his job properly.&rsquo;  The mother is ashamed because she became hysterical when she saw her son had been transformed into a bug and could not help him.  Meg disregards the comments from her parents as she offers snap judgments such as &lsquo;Gregory was not in that bug&rsquo; and &lsquo;If he was good riddance&rsquo;.  Gregory&rsquo;s father does not accept this kind of behavior and sends Gregory&rsquo;s sister to her room.  In fact, the sister has not thought about her brother since his death.<br>
  That night, while sleeping, the sister dreams about a figure that looks like her brother.  Gregory speaks to her as if they were speaking to each other between his business trips.  Gregory begins to speak to Meg about his sadness, and she begins to weep, remembering the apple lodged in his giant bug like body.  &lsquo;My life as a traveling salesman is insignificant, this debt on the family makes it worse, and father has no appreciation of my hard work&rsquo;.  Meg responds, &lsquo;You were not being heard or cared for, Why did you not ask father to help you out instead of leaving us behind?  Why did you leave me behind?&rsquo;  Gregory responds, &lsquo;The pressure on this family was too much; and I knew father would not help with anything he didn&rsquo;t care about.&rsquo;  Meg replies, &lsquo;Now that you&rsquo;re gone, we all have jobs and are making money&rsquo;.  Gregory says, &lsquo;My one wish was to send you to the conservatory for a better life and I have failed&hellip;&rsquo;  Suddenly, the shock from the conversation startled Meg awake.<br>
  <br>
  Meg Samsa woke from uneasy dreams one morning to find herself changed into a giant winged creature.  She attempts to look around, but feels that the perspective of the room has changed, in both size and color.  She perceives that everything is dark.  She can hear incredibly well, to judge from the sounds of the crickets outside her bedroom window.  She wants to speak (Gregory tried too), but fears she will wake her father and mother.  She gets out of bed, but she cannot walk; she hovers over the floor and hears the persistent sound of flapping in the background.  &lsquo;What happened to me?&rsquo; she thought.  Meg sends pulses; she begins to see the room where she remembered sle
  eping last night.  Strangely, though, she is suspended in the air above her bed.  It seems she can fly!<br>
  <br>
  She unexpectedly heard her father&rsquo;s voice from the other room, &lsquo;Meg&rsquo; and suddenly remembering Gregory&rsquo;s predicament, the morning he could not unlock his door.  She panicked and asked herself &lsquo;What if father and mother see me like this?&rsquo;  &lsquo;Are they going to shut me out like we did to that other thing?&rsquo;  &lsquo;Am I going to die too?&rsquo; quickly, she responded to her father in an altered voice, &lsquo;I am still getting ready.&rsquo;  Her father, pressed for time before the train that would take them to work, she immediately caught sight of a bug crawling on the floor.  She saw a spider in the corner and a fly on the windowsill and had an uncontrollable urge to feed on them.  After she ate the first bug, she thought to herself, Gregory.<br>
  <br>
  She recalled her vivid dream.  She remembered how Gregory felt, pressured and completely disconnected from his life.  &lsquo;Am I going to feel the same way?&rsquo; she said.  At that very moment, the father notices that her room door is open and peeks.  He looks around the room and is puzzled not to see Meg.  Her father about to step away, then looks up and sees the fully winged, giant creature creeping on the ceiling to the wall.  In terror, he rushes away and calls for Meg.  The mother, getting anxious, comes to see what has happened and walks towards her room.  She opens the door fully and in front of her face is a giant black creature fluttering its wings around, the mother immediately faints.  The father drags his wife to the living room and accidently leaves the door to Meg&rsquo;s room open.<br>
  <br>
  Finally, Meg understands that she will feel better outside and flies out of the room.  As enters the hall, she sees a bug, consumes it, and continues her flight towards an open door or window.  She realizes how Gregory must have felt when his family turned against him.  She recalled her thoughts to her brother, &ldquo;We must somehow get rid of it&rdquo; (1995), &ldquo;It has to go&rdquo; (1995), and If it were he would long ago have seen the impossibility of people living in the same house as such an animal would have gone away of its own accord&rdquo; (1995), who she once loved and adored.  She completely dehumanized Gregory by calling this person trapped in a giant bugs body &ldquo;it&rdquo;.  As she leaves the apartment behind, she begins seeking the darkness of the eaves of the nearby buildings.</p>
<p align="left" class="style3">15. <em>The Violin </em><br>
by Jonathan Stout </p>
<p align="left" class="style15"> Two years had passed since Gregor&rsquo;s death and Grete was now married.  She still worked as a shop assistant and had become secure with her new life.  Her husband David, was a man of wealth which was new for Grete, since her family had always struggled with finances.  Due to these struggles, Grete felt a sense of satisfaction with earning her own money and stored it in case it was needed.     Grete&rsquo;s passion however was not her job but the beautiful music she was able to make with the violin.  One cold evening in November, Grete&rsquo;s husband arrived home.  	<br>
  <br>
&ldquo;Hello Dear! Grete smiled brightly as her husband entered the house, which was warm and smelled of the meal Grete was cooking.  Hello Grete, I am very tired, I had a long day at work.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s ok dear, I made you a meal of fresh turkey and potatoes and I will play my music for you after!  O Grete as much as I would love to hear your music I must sleep after dinner because tomorrow morning I am off early.&rdquo;  	<br>
<br>
Grete and husband sat down to dinner, which was neatly prepared on the table. Grete tried to smile but inside she was saddened by her husband&rsquo;s indifference when she offered to play music for him.  The violin was an escape for Grete.  She became lost in the sweet rhythms and beautiful melodies that came from the instrument.  She thought back to her days as a young adult and how Gregor would listen intently to her music and his desire to send her away to school to perfect her craft.  David enjoyed her playing but did not see a future for Grete involving the violin.  He found it ludicrous that Gregor wanted to send her to school, considering it a waist of money.  David felt Grete should be a wife to him and not pursue her passions.  	<br>
<br>
Grete tried to block out Gregor&rsquo;s transformation into a giant vermon and feared David&rsquo;s reaction if he was ever able to find out the truth about Gregor&rsquo;s death.  Grete also worried about her families&rsquo; financial situation due to the fact Gregor was no longer alive.  David knew of Grete&rsquo;s families need for money and did not feel it was he or Grete&rsquo;s place to help them.  	</p>
<p align="left" class="style15">&ldquo;May we give my father some money David, he recently was laid off from his position in the bank and he and mother can not afford rent?&rdquo;  No, we have been married less then ten months and this is the third time you have asked me for such a favor.&rdquo;  Grete began to speak in a harsher tone but was cut off by David shutting the door to the bedroom saying he needed his rest.  Shouldn&rsquo;t my husband want to help if he loves me and has more than enough money to do so, Grete thought to herself?  She lay down beside her husband who was already fast asleep and began to cry softly.  Since Gregor&rsquo;s passing Grete struggled to realize the sacrifices Gregor made for her family and her.  She struggled separating the more recent memories of Gregor as a giant vermon and the memory of the beloved brother she had adored as a child and teen.  She finally fell into a deep sleep.	</p>
<p align="left" class="style15">A time passed, David became more agitated with Grete and the burden of her family.  He also thought of the violin as more of a hobby for Grete failing to recognize her talent.  Grete continued playing the violin and began to realize her true gift.  She also felt her and David were growing apart and began doubting her love for him due to his constant irritation towards her in regards to her family and lack of interest in her pursuing her dream of the violin.  She decided to put David&rsquo;s feelings to the test.  	&ldquo;David, I want to go to school and learn to play the violin as a professional.  O dearest Grete, David replied, have you not realized there is no future in such an instrument.&rdquo;  Grete becoming more frustrated, it is my dream it is what I want to do.&rdquo;  &ldquo;You need to work more&rdquo; David replied with complete indifference that is where you make money not by playing the violin at night.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Now give me some piece in quite I need rest.&rdquo;  Grete feeling completely rejected knew what she must do.  	</p>
<p align="left" class="style15">Two days later while David was away on business, Grete packed up her things, left David a letter explaining why she felt she needed to leave, and ran away.  She went to her parents house with a portion of the money she saved and told them of her plan.  Although skeptical, Grete&rsquo;s father did not react well, &ldquo;How will we support ourselves with Gregor gone and you gone what will we do?&rsquo;  Without any words, Grete handed her father a portion of the money she had saved.  &ldquo;This should last you until I come, you will be ok father.  Grete&rsquo;s mother in tears knew this was the right decision.  &ldquo;We will be ok, Grete her mother stated, go follow your dream.&rdquo;  Grete smiled and left her parents home.  Walking down the street towards the train station she again thought of Gregor.  &ldquo;This is what she wanted&rdquo; Grete said to herself, he is the only person who believed in me.&rdquo;  Grete boarded the train, beginning her trip to The School of Music and Performing Arts in Vienna.</p>

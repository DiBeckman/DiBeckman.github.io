  <p>*This and all subsequent references to Shannon are from Edward Shannon's <span class="text">The Prentice Hall Guide to Writing about Literature</span> (Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2002) which went out of print in 2010. I  replaced it with <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> as a textbook for our class. Details about what he means by &quot;confusing, repeated, familiar and strange&quot; can be found <a href="222Shannonmore.html">here</a>.</p>
  <p>Write a one-paragraph to one-page summary of Chapter 1 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>. Include the title of each chapter in your heading, since   it should reflect the main point of the chapter. Your summary should include the main points and any others that seem especially helpful or surprising to you. Some students prefer to an outline format or question format. (See <a href="222ShortGuideSample.pdf">this example</a> of a question format and <a href="222ASGoutline.pdf">this example</a> of an outline format.) Outlining, writing questions, and summarizing are all useful skills. You may handwrite or type it, and you may include it on the same page with your discussion of the first stanza of <span class="text">Essay on Man. </span>You may submit<span class="text"> A Short Guide</span> assignments electronically since I will not make extensive comments on them. If they are submitted electronically, they will be returned to you electronically. </p>
  <p> Print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222Enlightenment.html">The Enlightenment</a> and <a href="222GreatChain.html">The Great Chain of Being</a> if you want to use them to take notes.</p>
<p>In addition, for this and the next assignment, take a look at  my web page on <a href="Explication.html"><em>Explication de Texte</em></a> and these web sites about figures of speech which are also listed on the handy <a href="222supmatf04.html">Supplementary Materials</a> page. These pages will  be useful for your <a href="222poetrypresentation.html">Poetry Presentation</a> due on <span class="date">January 30 and February 2</span>.</p>

    <li>Here is <a href="http://grammar.about.com/od/terms/a/revquiz20terms.htm?p=1">a quiz</a> you can take to assess your knowledge of the &quot;Top 20 figures of speech&quot; by Richard Norquist.</li>
    <li> <a href="http://www.nipissingu.ca/faculty/williams/figofspe.htm">This site</a> contains figures of speech, thought, repetition, more than you can shake a stick at! Most examples are drawn from Shakespeare. </li>
    <li> <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/rhetoricaldevicesinsound.htm">This site</a> is very cool because it has sound clips and draws from a wide range of speeches, movies, and more to illustrate the Figures of Speech. For example, see and listen to quotes from Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln, and Neil Armstrong on <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/figures/antithesis.htm">the page about antitheses</a>.</li>

  <ol>
    <li>Read <span class="text">Essay on Man</span> and write a page about your stanza to turn in. In case you're not sure what a <em>stanza</em> is, you can look this and other literary terms up in our course <a href="222Glossary.html">Glossary</a>, the Glossary in Appendix B of <span class="text">A Short Guide to Writing About Literature</span>, or the <a href="http://wwnorton.com/college/english/nawest9/literaryterms.aspx">Glossary</a> on the Norton web site.<br />
      <br />
Note that the Roman numerals I-X at the beginning of each stanza correspond to your assigned stanza number (not a page or line number). What is the stanza about? Give a one-sentence summary. Answer  Shannon's 4 questions. Also, what are the key words and images in the stanza? How does the stanza connect with the ideas of the Enlightenment we've discussed? What is  the attitude of the narrator? What is the role of nature, especially animals, if any appear in your stanza?</li>
    <li>Write a one-paragraph to one-page summary or outline of Chapter 2 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> to turn in. Take, correct, and turn in your answers to the Quiz in Appendix B  364-371 of <span class="text">A Short Guide.</span></li>

<h2 class="class">Class 5 (Voltaire, Lecture 2) <span class="date">due Friday, January 16</span></h2>
<ul><li> Discuss the following questions after you do the reading assignment (Chapters 14-22). Quote from the text with examples to support your answers and include the page reference for each quotation.
          <ul>
            <li>Is Eldorado a genuine utopia or (in one critic's words) &quot;a colossal bore&hellip;satirized by Voltaire as foolish and futile&quot;?</li>
            <li>Which specific behaviors or institutions show us that Voltaire wants the reader to see Eldorado as utopic?</li>
            <li>Does Voltaire have a philosophical lesson in mind or is it pure satire? Or both?</li>
            <li>How does it correspond to your personal view of Utopia?</li></ul>
        </li>
</ul>
<ul><li>See Lecture Notes on <a href="222dulce.html">Dulce et utile</a>.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Read Chapter 3 in <em>A Short Guide</em> and write a summary to turn in.</li></ul>
 <ul><li>The first original contribution post&mdash;on Pope&mdash;is due <span class="date">tonight</span> at midnight. You will have many authors to choose from to do your required 14 posts (7 original contributions and 7 responses), but I encourage you to get in the habit of posting by starting with Pope or Voltaire. For an original contribution post, make a point or develop an argument of at least <span class="red">one  full paragraph (5-8 sentences)</span> based on something you read, learned or thought while reading <em>An Essay on Man</em>. Ask a question or make a provocative statement for your classmates to respond to. You may also include a quote from the text under discussion or links to other web sites. Did something in your homework get praise or a lot of comment from me? If so, it might be the basis of a good post.
</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="class">Class 6 (Voltaire, Lecture 3)</span> <span class="date">due Wednesday, January 21</span></h2>
 <p>Read the page in Supplementary Materials, <a href="Candide%20quotes.html">Quotes from different critics about &quot;Il faut cultiver notre jardin.&quot;</a> Write a page which includes answers to the following questions: what are some  literal and figurative meanings of the word <em>garden</em>? How do they apply to Candide's garden? How do <strong>you</strong> interpret the final line of the story? </p>
 <p>To help you to understand the difference between <strong>literal</strong> and <strong>figurative</strong>, here is  an example I found online:</p>
 <blockquote>
   <p><strong>literal</strong> vs. <strong>figurative</strong> meaning - relates to the meanings of words and phrases or expressions. For example, &quot;She was all ears&quot; has a <strong>figurative</strong> meaning (She was listening intently) as well as a <strong>literal</strong> meaning (Her body was composed of ears or she had a huge set of ears). <span class="citation"><a href="http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm">Literary Terms for English</a></span></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>Read <em>A Short Guide</em> Chapter 4, and write a summary to turn in.</p>
<p>Recommended reading before <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~dsbeckma/222Romanticismillustrated.html">Romanticism</a>: <em>Preface </em>xxi-xxvi; the rest of <em>What is Enlightenment?</em> 16-52 in the Norton Anthology.</p>
 <p><strong><span class="extracredit">Extra Credit Opportunities</span></strong>: In honor of the Martin Luther King Holiday, watch and/or read MLK's celebrated <span class="text"><a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkihaveadream.htm">I Have a Dream</a></span> speech  and write a page about it from a literary perspective. How did it entertain and instruct? What figures of speech or rhetoric were used? Any literary allusions? What was repeated and familiar? (Ideally, not too much will be strange or confusing.) If you prefer, you could also choose the lyrics from your favorite song, and write a short literary analysis, with special focus on the figures of speech used there.</p>

</ol>
<ol>
  <div class="maroon">
    <h3>FORMALIST CRITICISM:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>How do the names of individual characters tie into the main messages within <em>Madame Bovary</em>?  Are the names meant to hold hidden significance (Leon could be lion, Justin could be justice, Rodolphe could be rodent, etc.)? </li>
      <li>How does Flaubert's use of free indirect discourse reinforce the overall meaning of the story? Is it simply stylistic or does it enhance the meaning? </li>
      <li>Flaubert alters the tempo throughout <em>Madame Bovary</em>, by briefly mentioning certain events and going into great length on others. What is the purpose of this and how does this benefit the story?</li>
      <li>Does Emma's taste in literature have a specific connection to the plot of <em>Madame Bovary</em>?  If so, what is the significance of these allusions and how do they enhance the plot?</li>
      <li>How does Emma's Romantic personality and point of view on life and love contribute to the meaning of this Realist novel?</li>
      <li>How are the images/symbols such as books, windows, and horses used to raise issues within the work and do these issues become resolved?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h3>SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
  <div class="red">
    <h4>Marxist Criticism:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>How do the townspeople of Yonville represent the different classes of society? </li>
      <li>Which social class is Flaubert frustrated with and how does he portray this in the story?</li>
      <li>In <em>Madame Bovary</em>, who represents the proletariat social class and who represents the bourgeoisie? What affect do these social classes have on the characters' views on themselves in society?</li>
      <li>How does Flaubert use Emma to portray the covetous human being who desires to better one's economic conditions? How are Charles and Rodolphe used as examples to show each class structure's lifestyles? Were they aware of it?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="purple">
    <h4>Feminist Criticism: </h4>
    <ul>
      <li> How do female and male characters value each other and how does this impact their decisions/what message their behavior sends?</li>
      <li> What does a particular character's gender and personality combination add to the story?</li>
      <li>How was Flaubert's writing influenced by his personal life? Did he consult any women in the writing of the story?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="teal">
    <h3>CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Do you think Flaubert accurately portrays the way housewives during this time period lived? Because the Romantic period had just come to an end, do you think the majority of women were caught up in this same idea of passionate love that consumes Emma, or is she an exceptional case?</li>
      <li>During the mid 1800's in which Madame Bovary is framed, is there a cultural difference in how a woman is viewed in society after committing adultery in comparison to the man in which the adultery is committed? How is this displayed within Madame Bovary?</li>
      <li>What would Emma do/How would she react if she was suddenly moved down (or up) a class level? That is to say, if she were to become very very poor, or very very rich and influential instead of her current middle class life?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="orange">
    <h3>PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In <em>Madame Bovary, </em>what examples from the text suggest that Emma may actually be suffering from a mental illness? Which mental illness do you think this is and why? </li>
      <li>Should Emma ever reach her perfect and ideal life (ie. sophistication, romance), would she ever be truly happy? Is happiness a possibility for Emma?</li>
      <li>What do the character's emotions and behavior reveal about their psychological states? What types of personalities are they?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="blue">
    <h3>READER RESPONSE CRITICISM:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Who was <em>Madame Bovary</em>'s iintended audience? To what extent are you similar or dissimilar to that audience?</li>
      <li>How would the story have changed if divorce were legal in France at this time?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="green">
    <h3>ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The story takes place in the French countryside which makes it impossible for Charles to stay at home and see all of his clients.  Would the affair with Rodolphe have happened if Charles had lived in a city where his clients only came to see him?</li>
      <li>In what way(s) does Emma's environment contribute to her desires?</li>
      <li>How does the setting in Madame Bovary influence the characters, and how do changes in setting correspond to the plot and the decisions the characters make?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="fuchsia">
    <h3>QUEER THEORY: </h3>
    <ul><li>How does the sexuality of Charles and Emma affect their differing expectations of what a relationship should be? </li>
      <li>Does Emma's religion affect her inclination to express herself sexual, is her sexuality sinful? As readers, has anyone ever questioned Charles sexuality?</li>
    </ul>

<p>After finishing the story,  answer your own question, or another student's  based on the <strong>whole</strong> story. In other words, how might we interpret the <span class="text">Metamorphosis</span> through the lens of Formalist, Marxist, Feminist&hellip; criticism? Think especially about the violin scene, the death scene and the final paragraph. </p>

    <li>Why does the first sentence contain what could be described as the climax of the story?</li>

<div class="teal">
  <h3>CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Would Gregor's family have treated the situation differently if it happened today? </li>
    <li>Do you think Gregor symbolizes Kafka and his ostracism based on the fact that he had a German background in a new Czech-speaking republic?</li>

  <h3>PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Why does Gregor seem to take his metamorphosis so much easier than his family? </li>
    <li>Does Gregor's transformation into a giant vermin reflect that Gregor's mindset all along was one of a vermin or does it reflect that when one works his life away he becomes a vermin?</li>

    <li>Why did Kafka choose an insect instead of another animal as Gregor's transformed being? Why did a normal, ordinary person such as Gregor have to go through this negative situation and potentially lose his job and become a burden to his family with problems he cannot control?</li>

<h2><span class="class">Class 34 (Thesis exercise and Peer review of Term Paper proposal) </span><span class="date">due Friday, April 10</span></h2>
<p>The first part of class will be devoted to <em>The Thesis Exercise</em>. Read the <a href="222Thesis exercise.html">web page</a> about how to write a thesis for a literary paper. Print and fill out the <a href="222Theses.html">page of sample FL 222 theses</a> where you rate the examples. The second half of class will be devoted to peer review of the first pre-draft of your <a href="222Paper2010.html">Paper</a>. Print out <strong>two copies</strong> of the <a href="Peerevaluation2.pdf">Peer Review Feedback Form</a> to include with the <strong>two copies</strong> of your draft which you will bring for your classmates. Fill out the top part of the form with your name, paper title, and date. Do <strong>not wait</strong> until the last minute to print these materials out. Email me before class if you have an idea for your own original topic so that I can approve it. Speaking of original, a very creative paper where almost all the main characters meet in Hell written by a former student is featured <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~dsbeckma/To Hell with Literature.htm"> here</a>, and my favorite missing chapter of <em>Candide</em> is <a href="222VoltaireCandide.html">here</a>. The complete first draft will be due to me on <span class="date">Wednesday, April 15.</span></p>
<p>Selected writing advice from the <a href="222Paper2010.html">Term Paper page:</a></p>
<p>Read through the topic choices below. Consult Chapter 10 in <span class="text"> A Short Guide, Writing about Fiction: the World of the Story</span>, especially the pages on &quot;Getting Ideas&quot; (171-5).  Which texts have been your favorite or challenged you the most? Send me an email or make an appointment if you need help deciding on a topic. <span class="red">If you are doing a creative project, you will not have a <strong>thesis </strong>per se in your rough draft, but you will replace that with a <strong>story premise </strong>that explains what the goal of your project is and how it relates to the text(s) you are responding to. </span></p>
<h2>Paper Topics</h2>
<p><strong>A. Critical creative rewriting</strong></p>
<p>You become the author/artist. Take one of your favorite stories, poems or plays and imagine what happens to the characters after the story ends. You could also rewrite the story before it starts or focus on an important scene from a <em>different</em> character's point of view: Cun&eacute;gonde's, Berthe's or Gerasim's&hellip; One student rewrote Pope's <span class="text">Essay on Man</span> in the format of Baudelaire's &quot;Enivirez-vous.&quot; You could also write a letter from one character to another in the same story or a different story. For example: What advice would Rodolphe give Ashenbach? For a model, see <a href="http://grammar.about.com/od/classicessays/a/franklinmis.htm">Ben Franklin's letter of &quot;Advice on Choosing a Mistress</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the author's narrative style, plot, characterization, vocabulary and imagery, so that you can imitate it (or even make a parody of it). If you use direct quotes from the original text, put these passages <em>in italics. </em>Include the page reference for your quote. Do not include historical anachronisms, such as a telephone in <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> or snooze button on Gregor's alarm clock.</p>
<p> The <strong>creative</strong> part of the paper should be two to three pages long. </p>
<p>The second half of the paper will be the <strong>critical </strong>portion: a writing journal or commentary. It should also be a minimum of three pages long for the final version. Explain the stages of your project: first, the choice of story or character, next, the problems and reflections you had while rewriting, including all the ideas you came up with and rejected and the reasons why. Some of the other ideas may lead to other projects later and it is good to have a record of them. Finally, include what you learned about your author and text and the process of writing. For example, what did you notice about your author's style when you read the story for class? What did you notice for the first time during or after class? How did your observation or appreciation of his/her style change as you worked on imitating it? For specifics, be sure to mention the criteria listed <a href="222ImitateStyle.html">here</a>.  The writing journal portion of this paper  is one of the rare occasions in a college paper where it is appropriate to use &quot;I,&quot; as you recount your experience as a writer. </p>
<p>In other words, your <em>rewrite</em> is your <strong>response</strong> to a text. Your <em>commentary</em> is the <strong>reflection</strong> on that response. For the peer review draft, you should include a page of your rewriting and a page of commentary, perhaps an outline. You will not have a thesis, per se, but you should have a <strong>very clear story idea or premise for alternative art project</strong>. Date entries in your writer's journal. Each time you get new input, such as your peer reviews and your instructor review,  revise your creative section, and add to the journal section to reflect the new issues raised by the reviewers. </p>
<p>You can  read the stories written by students in previous semesters <a href="222CreativeWriting.htm">here</a>. An amazing example which includes the majority of characters studied in FL 222 is <em><a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~dsbeckma/To Hell with Literature.htm">To Hell With Literature</a></em>(Joey Schopper, Fall 2006).</p>
<p>Need a name for a character in your creative story? To get the nationality right, check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_given_names">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_given_names</a></p>
<p><strong>B. Compare and contrast</strong> at least 2 texts from 2 different authors, including one 
  from the second half of the semester. <span class="red">Use the following comments as a <strong>guide</strong> to develop <strong>your own thesis</strong>. You do not need to answer all of them; you <strong>do</strong> need to have a coherent thesis.  Reminder: an thesis is not a topic, fact or opinion. It is an argument.</span> You may also choose your own topic. (See D below.)</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>The Function of Setting in</strong>&#133; (Tolstoy, Woolf, Kafka, Joyce, Brecht, 
    Camus&#133;)
    Discuss how the setting in these texts contributes to the main theme. Include 
    such issues as the history, particular location, spatial relations and the meaning 
    of movement from one space to another, the social meaning of space and place, 
    etc.</li>
  <li><strong> Illness, Disease and Death in</strong>&#133; (Flaubert, Tolstoy, Joyce, Mann, 
    Kafka&#133;) Describe how the authors represent illness, disease, and death, 
    and how these themes function in the texts. Pay attention to the societal aspects 
    of disease and death. Recommended reading&mdash;two articles  related to what I call <a href="222Isolationandcontact.html">The Gerasim Effect</a>&mdash;<em>The United States holds tens of thousands of inmates in long-term solitary confinement. Is this torture?</em> by Atul Gawande  and <em>Comforter and Comforted in an Unfolding Mystery</em> by Nell Burger Kirst. </li>
  <li><strong> The representation of gender roles in</strong>&#133;What positions do men and women occupy in society? What is expected of them because of their gender? What limitations does their gender impose? How does it shape romantic love? What are the differences between married love and romantic love that are portrayed? You may end with a comparison to contemporary gender roles.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>C. Text and Film/ Theater</strong>. See a filmed version of one of the texts we have read 
  in class or attend one of the plays performed locally this semester. Films can be viewed online or at DH Hill (see <a href="https://reserves.lib.ncsu.edu/"> reserve</a> holdings for our class). Write an analysis comparing the two&#151;consider how reading 
  and watching film are different. For example, <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span>, &quot;The Dead,&quot; &quot;The Lady with a Dog,&quot; &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest,&quot; and <span class="text">Death in Venice</span> have all been made into films. Your thesis should focus your evaluation of how the filmed version relates to the text version. Is it a successful, weak or failed adaptation? Is it a respectful hommage? A brilliant or flawed reworking of the original? </p>
<p> Here are some questions to think about: </p>
<ul>
  <li>What scenes were left out and what scenes were added? How did these changes 
    improve or detract from the story? You might want to concentrate on one element 
    or even one scene, such as the ending.</li>
  <li>How would you rate the director and the 
    choice of cast? Did the actors who played the roles in the film conform to your 
    expectations?</li>
  <li>How does the use of language, or the way certain actors behave, 
    imply a whole range of characteristics described in words in the book?</li>
  <li>Did the 
    director set the right tone for the film?</li>
  <li>How is seeing a play performed different than reading it?</li>
</ul>
<p>See &quot;Getting Ideas for Writing about a Film Based on a Work of Literature&quot; (176-78) or &quot;Getting Ideas for Writing about a Film Based on a Play&quot; (216-20) in <span class="text"> A Short Guide</span>.</p>
<p>If you are using a novel that has been remade into film several times, you might 
  want to consider the same scene in more than one version and think about time-related 
  choices. For instance, <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> has been remade in almost every decade 
  of the 20th century, incuding versions by Jean Renoir in 1933, Vincent Minnelli in 1949, and Claude Chabrol in 1991.  The emphasis in the films is different in part because 
  each reflects its own time and the ideas of its director.</p>
<p>See <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> (339) to cite a film or DVD. A useful site to find important quotes from movies: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Search/quotes">http://www.imdb.com/Search/quotes</a>. It is also often useful to listen to the director's commentary, if you are using a DVD with this feature.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> You may also propose <strong>your own topic</strong> as long as it is a <strong>comparison</strong>.  Your proposed topic must be submitted 
  to me for approval by the date of the peer review.</p>
<p>Sample topics from previous semesters: Blake's &quot;London&quot; and Wordsworth's &quot;Composed on Westminster Bridge&quot;; Autumn poems by Keats, Baudelaire, Verlaine and Auden; Death-bed scenes in Dickinson's 465 &quot;I heard a Fly buzz&quot; or 712 &quot;Because I could not stop for Death,&quot; and Emma's death scene in <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> or Ivan's in <span class="text">The Death of Ivan Ilyich</span>; <span class="text">Candide</span> and <span class="text">Forrest Gump</span>; Utopias in <span class="text">Candide</span> and <span class="text">The Village</span>; <span class="text">Wedding Crashers</span> and <span class="text">The Importance of Being Earnest</span>; <span class="text">Slumdog Millionaire</span> and <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> or <span class="text">Candide</span>; &quot;A Room of One's Own&quot; and Michael Cunningham's <span class="text"> The Hours;</span> <em>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</em> and Abrom's <span class="text">Tuesdays with Morrie</span>; <a href="222ASG14.html">Paintings and Poems</a>&hellip; The list goes on&hellip;</p>

<p>Choose the most provocative or thought-provoking statement in <strong>Chapter 2</strong> (ie not Chapter 1) of the assignment. Include the page number. Write a paragraph (or more) agreeing or disagreeing. Be prepared to read your passage out loud in class and explain why you think it is provocative or thought-provoking.</p>

  <li> Who is Judith Shakespeare? Why does Woolf create her? What is the message about women and women writers that Woolf suggests by telling Judith's story? Is Judith fact, fiction, truth, a lie?</li>
  <li> Choose any work we've read so far and speculate about how it might have been different if the work had been written by a woman rather than a man. (There is no right or wrong answer: let your imagination take you somewhere. Would the characters be different? The plot? The ending? How does the author's gender impact his or her art?) </li>

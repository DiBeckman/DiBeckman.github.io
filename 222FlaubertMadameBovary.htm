  <p align="center" class="style2">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center" class="style4">1 ) <em>The Terrible Storm</em><br>
  by Kyle Watson</p>
  <p align="left" class="style3">Dark clouds rolled in, dark as a coal miners face, dark as a midnight sky, dark as the depths of a cave. Darker still as time passed, dark like night, dark like chocolate, and the sky was black. Temperatures unseasonably cold for the summer day sent a chill that cut through all in attendance. The weather did not diminish the turnout, everyone who lived within a days ride was present, this was important. A clasp of thunder rumbled in the distance.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style3">&ldquo;Was that thunder?&rdquo; asked Homais, &ldquo;perhaps you should pray for good weather on this day of infamy.&rdquo; </p>
  <p align="left" class="style3">&ldquo;Come now, I am sure the Lord Our Savior has more pressing issues than the weather.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style3">&ldquo;Really now, what is more important then the Legion d&rsquo;honneur? Furthermore what is more important than the grand cordon? Today I will join the ranks of the elite, a grand cordon, one of only 75 men. What else could be more pressing to God then that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style3">The crowds swelled and the clouds darkened, this was the most people this town had seen in recent memory. It soon became apparent that the ceremony must be taken outside to accommodate the massive numbers. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style3">&ldquo;All these people here to pay tribute to me&rdquo;, said Homais, &ldquo;but really there should be more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style3">&ldquo;This is the most people I have seen in my life in our town&rdquo;, said the elderly man, &ldquo;you have brought honor and prestige to Yonville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style3">I have brought honor and prestige to myself; the town is lucky to have me, Homais quietly thought.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style3">The mayor inquired, &ldquo;Perhaps we should postpone to a day when the weather is more appropriate for such an occasion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style3">Homais interrupted, &ldquo;No weather is going to postpone my big day. I have worked too hard and long for this moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style3">The town square swelled, almost bursting at the seams to accommodate all the people. The ceremony started with an introductory speech from the mayor. Then before presenting the medal he opened up the floor for Monsieur Homais. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style3">Homais went on and on and the clouds got darker and darker. The thunder and lightning were growing closer now and the crowd was starting to thin. Realizing the impeding danger, the mayor cut off Homais and went on to the medal presentation. Homais feeling cheated reluctantly went along.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style3">The mayor gathered up the stash with the legion badge along with the star for the left chest that all grand cordons were allowed to wear. &ldquo;I now present these worldly honors to a man of honor&rdquo; </p>
  <p align="left" class="style3">Boom! All of a sudden the clouds parted and the sun shone through. An albatross flew through the city, grabbing everyone&rsquo;s attention, as it was uncommon to see the bird in this non-port town. When they did look back at the speakers platform, they saw Homais, sprawled on the floor grasping for what the mayor held, yet the it was out of reach. He opened his mouth to demand it, but nothing came out. He gasped his last breath. The mayor called for help, still Homais in his final moments yearned to grab the star, to obtain his dream. Homais died right there on the stage reaching, with his arm eternally reaching for his crowning achievement, an achievement never received.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style3">Time passed and the truth came out about his unlicensed treatment of patients and corruption, the government rescinded the grand cordon and the practice of gaining power by immoral means was forever known as &ldquo;pulling an Homais&rdquo;. So Homais was immortalized after all in slang. So if anyone ever tells you that your pulling an Homais, it might be time to examine the path that you are on. </p>
  <p align="center" class="style5">2) <em>My Dearest Emma</em><br>
  by Kinsey Brooks</p>
  <p align="left"> My Dearest Emma,</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have become quite worried about you since you last wrote to me a few months ago.&nbsp; Your letters have gotten fewer and farther in between, and one might wonder what exactly is going through your troubled little head.&nbsp; Getting married to the first commoner you can charm into thinking you are adorable&mdash;how smashing!&nbsp; But it is not important, I suppose, because it is to my great misfortune that it is the duty of today&rsquo;s woman to find a suitable husband, and no doubt Charles Bovary is quite suitable for the likes of you.&nbsp; And I am quite sure that there is nothing I can do or say that will change your mind, but please, my dear, I do implore you to hear me out, as it were.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your growing dependencies on men are quite alarming.&nbsp; I can understand how frustrating it must be to live with your father and the cows and the chickens, and I also understand why you long for a life less provincial and more exciting and romantic.&nbsp; But why, I ask you, does that mean that you jump at the first chance you ever get to become married?&nbsp; Where is the romance in a marriage spawned from cunning and opportunity?&nbsp; Surely you cannot be interested in life with that country &ldquo;doctor&rdquo;; he is hardly fit to apply a proper dressing on a child&rsquo;s scratched knee!&nbsp; Charles Bovary?&nbsp; Charles Bovary?!&nbsp; I suppose at the very least he could provide a nice salary off of which the two of you could live comfortably, but do you not want more from your marriage, or even more from your own life?&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t there more to living than just having a husband, bearing his children, making a hot meal for him when he comes home late at night, and spending all of his money?</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps I am losing my temper with you.&nbsp; I simply do not want to see you make a terrible, horrible mistake.&nbsp; I consider myself extremely fortunate that I do not have to marry at all, due to the allowance left to me by my aunt in her will.&nbsp; I suppose, had her unfortunate end not turned out in my favor, I would have already been married to some man my family deemed appropriate.&nbsp; It is a shame because I would never have had a say in how my own life would have turned out, but now, I can write as much as I want and live a modest but definitely comfortable life.&nbsp; But is that really important in the grand scheme of things?&nbsp; If you are happy with Charles, then that is all that matters, but you must be sure that you are really, truly happy.&nbsp; Marriage is not to be entered into lightly.&nbsp; If this were a perfect world women would not need to get married because men would see us as their equals in every way, and they would not be afraid to say so.&nbsp; But this is only my little dream world where women can support themselves all on their own and follow their dreams without fear of being persecuted by those who are frightened by the prospect of a woman taking care of herself all on her own.&nbsp; Why should either of us care what an arbitrary rule-making man thinks is proper?</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please do not be offended by the frankness of my letter to you, dear friend, but I am so concerned with your well-being.&nbsp; I do wish that you would take my advice to heart; I have your interests in mind, I promise that with the utmost sincerity.&nbsp; Please, do write back.&nbsp; I am keenly interested to know how this all turns out, marriage or no marriage.&nbsp; I wish you the best either way.</p>
  <p align="left">Sincerely,</p>

  2 ) <em>The Return of Berthe</em><br>
  by Kareem Ayad
  </span>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The story begins ten years since the death of Emma.&nbsp; Much has changed in the city of Tostes.&nbsp; Homais has reached new heights by becoming the city&rsquo;s governor.&nbsp; Charles Bovary was sentenced to ten years in prison for not paying off his debts.&nbsp; His life fell apart after the death of Emma and he fell into a state of depression.&nbsp; He is due out this month but has lost all contact with his daughter Berthe and has no idea what has happened to her.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You there, yes you, with the black coat, what brings you to my place of business?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am looking for work Sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What is your name boy?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Justin.&rdquo;&nbsp; The overweight man gave Justin a hard look from head to toe and said, &ldquo;Well, Monsieur Justin you&rsquo;re in luck we are in need of young men for our next trip.&nbsp; You be here tomorrow no later than noon or we leave without you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you Sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; As Justin stepped down and out of line, the heavy and very obese man yelled &ldquo;Next!&rdquo; as more men stepped up and tried to find themselves more work.&nbsp; Work was scarce since the war ended, many soldiers returned home to find themselves looking for work.&nbsp; Justin joined the army not to serve his country but to escape his own guilt.&nbsp; He would sit through cold nights blaming himself for the death of Emma and would visit her grave on an everyday basis.&nbsp; Justin, now a young handsome man was back from the army, and was in the small town of Chermon.&nbsp; He had short brown curly hair, and big brown eyes, a very stern and bold face with islands of light brown hairs growing on his cheeks and chin.&nbsp; He was neither tall nor short but a good medium sized man.&nbsp; It was a cold November night and snow had just begun to fall, Justin thought to himself that he must find a place to stay for the night.&nbsp; He checked himself into a small hotel with the little money he had and prepared himself for tomorrows work.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning Justin woke up bright and early and headed to the shipyard where he found a job.&nbsp; Justin knew the gates were still locked because he saw about twenty to thirty men standing outside waiting.&nbsp; The snow was now sticking to the ground and was almost barely at an inch, many men huddled around a barrel of fire to keep warm others just tightened there one layered coats and buried there faces into their hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Excuse me Sir, what time do you have&rdquo; asked Justin, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about twelve thirty&rdquo; answered the old man who looked as if he had worked his entire life.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand the man yesterday told me to be here no later than noon&rdquo; the old man then said &ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t worry about him lad, Monsieur Thierry is always late&rdquo;.&nbsp; Just as the old man finished his sentence I could see men being parted down the middle to make way for a man in white.&nbsp; Then a sudden voice was heard from behind the gates, &ldquo;Line up men! All men line up&rdquo;.&nbsp; All the men quickly left the fire and lined up in a straight horizontal line, so that we were all facing towards the gate.&nbsp; No one moved or dared to speak, totally silence fell over the whole area.&nbsp; The sounds of the sea echoed in the background as the waves crashed into the rocks on the shore.&nbsp; The men kept there eyes forward as the man in white approached from behind the straight line.&nbsp; He had a slight gimp in his walk and used a cane to help balance himself.&nbsp; The combination of his steel toe boots and his cane formed a rhythmic sound like the hands of a clock going tick tock tick tock tick tock.&nbsp; He was a rather tall man, with a moustache that stretched across his face and curled up at each end.&nbsp; He had a sharp nose with a clean but pale face.&nbsp; His wore a top hat with his long straight black hair hanging from each side of the hat.&nbsp; His jacket hung from his shoulders and his arms rested by his side.&nbsp; A very small and stubble fat man walked beside him holding a list of everyone&rsquo;s names.&nbsp; He stopped right at the old man before Justin.&nbsp; &ldquo;You Sir are not cut out for this type of work; you&rsquo;re to old, go home and find some other type of work.&rdquo;&nbsp; The old man simply picked up his bag and stepped out of the line and vanished into the town market.&nbsp; He then came to Justin, looked him dead in the eyes and then took a step closer.&nbsp; Justin could now feel the tall mans breath on his face but continued to look forward.&nbsp; The tall man then pulled a knife from his pocket and pointed it at Justin as if he was going to cut his ear off and in a sudden swipe he sliced a loose string from Justin&rsquo;s collar.&nbsp; The man looked at Justin one more time then continued down the line.&nbsp; A small drop of sweat made it down Justin&rsquo;s forehead and then evaporated into his cheek as he sighed in relief.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am Monsieur Jack Thierry and this is my shipyard.&nbsp; You will be paid once the job is finished and if you do well then I shall pay you well, and if you do bad well then I will make sure you never work another day in.&rdquo; Just as Monsieur Thierry was finishing a man interrupted him and yelled from the line &ldquo;How do we know we will be paid at the end of the job?&rdquo;&nbsp; Monsieur Thierry in a rage of anger walked up to the man and pulled out his cane and slapped him across the face with it.&nbsp; The man fell to his knees and a river of blood rushed from his nose as he spit out blood from his mouth.&nbsp; Then two men dressed in black grabbed the poor man by the arms and dragged him from the line.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not tolerate trouble makers in my business&rdquo; yelled Thierry &ldquo;If you wish to speak you raise your hand and you step forward&rdquo;.&nbsp; Thierry then asked, &ldquo;If there are no questions I will tell you why you all are here.&nbsp; We will be traveling to the city of Tostes I have a shipment of cotton and other goods that need to be picked up and transported back here to my shipyard.&nbsp; It will take almost all thirty of you to complete this task.&nbsp; Once you are back and the goods are transported you will be paid&rdquo;.&nbsp; A quick mental image came to Justin as soon as he heard the name Tostes he saw the grey eyes of Emma staring at him.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group of men arrived in Tostes right on time, and was heading to the main cotton mill of the city.&nbsp; All the streets and shops brought back cold distinct memories for Justin.&nbsp; He tried hard to block out his past and what he left behind but it was no use the thought of Emma would slowly creep back into his head.&nbsp; The Mill was in horrible shape, some of the windows were broken, the pipes on the outside were all rusted, and the paint on the building was beginning to peel revealing the ugly yellowish molds which the paint covered.&nbsp; The inside of the monstrous building was even worse.&nbsp; The roof was linking, a cold draft of wind flew in through the creaks of the broken windows, and the mill reeked of old mildew and burnt cotton.&nbsp; Women were the only workers in the mill and dressed themselves fully covering everything except there faces and hands.&nbsp; Reminded Justin of a church, full of Nuns all praying the way the women were all dressed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with you gentlemen in a minute&rdquo; yelled a man behind the dark corner.&nbsp; Justin and all the other men began to take off there jackets and sit down due to the long trip.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ahhhh Monsieur Thierry how do you do&rdquo; but before the man could finish Monsieur Thierry interrupted him, &ldquo;Listen Mr. Pires we have no time to talk we are here for the shipment and we must be on our way&rdquo;.&nbsp; Mr. Pires was an old man who had a long wrinkled face, his spectacles rested on his nose and his white beard covered his face just as the snow covered the streets outside.&nbsp; His white hair was combed over to erase his bald head but was brushed very poorly.&nbsp; His white suit had many stains of dirt and grease and he walked with a hump in his back.&nbsp; &ldquo;The shipment is here, fifty boxes of cotton are all here you will need to begin moving these out immediately before the storm gets worse outside&rdquo; said Mr. Pires.&nbsp; Monsieur Thierry then spoke &ldquo;ok boys take a break and then begin to load the goods we shall leave tomorrow morning&rdquo;.&nbsp; Monsieur Thierry then grabbed Mr. Pires close to his side so that his lips were almost inside of Pires ears.&nbsp; He whispered &ldquo;where is the girl, bring her to me&rdquo;.&nbsp; With this Mr. Pires signaled to one of the women who then got up and went downstairs to get the girl.&nbsp; Monsieur Thierry pulled himself a chair and told Pires to bring some tea for him and his men.&nbsp; Justin had now taken off his coat and made it into a small pillow for him to rest his head on as he stretched out on the floor.&nbsp; The skies were turning from a whitish grey now to a dark grey and a gust of wind kicked open one of the windows and the snow began to fall harder.&nbsp; Just as Justin rested his head on the floor he saw a young women approaching Monsieur Thierry.&nbsp; She was quite tall and slender; her long brown hair that had streaks of blond ran down to her mid back.&nbsp; Her rosy cheeks brought out her crystal blue mysterious eyes.&nbsp; Justin found himself lost in her eyes as she got closer.&nbsp; He would not dare look away.&nbsp; Thierry spoke, &ldquo;Madame Mary, we leave for Chermon in the morning so have your belongings ready&rdquo;.&nbsp; She looked into his eyes with a very submissive look and turned away without saying a word back downstairs.&nbsp; Monsieur Thierry probably had about fifteen to twenty years on the young beauty so old that it could be her father. All the boxes were loaded up and ready for departure.&nbsp; Every man found himself a small corner to sleep in for the night.&nbsp; Justin could not sleep he could not stop thinking of the young women earlier in the day.&nbsp; As the morning rolled through so did the storm.&nbsp; The snow was falling even harder and the clouds kept the sun from breaking through.&nbsp; The storm was getting closer, so it was important for the men to work fast to load the boxes of cotton and get back to Chermon.&nbsp; Justin saw Madame Mary gathering her belongings alone downstairs and thought to himself what an opportunity to introduce himself.&nbsp; He walked downstairs and walked straight up to her and stuttered over his own words &ldquo;mmm mmm my name is Justin&rdquo; and he extended his hand to her.&nbsp; She looked up at him with such a force that he had to take a step back due to her big glaring blue eyes.&nbsp; She then looked down and continued to collect her items.&nbsp; Feeling startled and intimidated Justin quickly rushed back upstairs without saying another word. </p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in Tostes, an old, tired and repentant Charles Bovary stood before the judge.&nbsp; His grey dirty blonde beard smothered his face accompanied by open wounds and scars on his neck.&nbsp; His eyes carried huge bags of wrinkles and his hair was now almost down to his shoulders.&nbsp; A gash above his left eye forced him to squint and there were holes in his smile from decaying rotten teeth.&nbsp; The judge looked firmly at him and spoke, &ldquo;Mr. Charles Bovary you have now served your maximum time in prison, have you paid for your crimes?&rdquo; Charles looked at the judge not clearly being able to see him &ldquo;your honor I have paid more for my crime and am ready to change my life.&rdquo;&nbsp; As he spoke air would escape through the gaps of his teeth and cause a slight whistle sound whenever he spoke.&nbsp; The judge looked at him with no mercy and only mere disgust, &ldquo;Mr. Charles Bovary you are to be exiled from this city, you must never show yourself here again you will be escorted out of the city limits and you will be on your own from there&rdquo;.&nbsp; Charles knew this was probably the end of his chances of ever finding his lost family.&nbsp; He fell to his knees and covered his tears with his old weightless wrinkled hands.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It had been about three weeks since the men returned from their journey from Tostes.&nbsp; The city was now preparing for the wedding of one of its wealthiest citizens which happened to be Monsieur Thierry.&nbsp; The city did not have much action but whenever Monsieur Thierry would throw any type of party hundreds upon hundreds of guests would arrive at his Estate.&nbsp; Rumor got around the city that the lucky lady was a poor girl that went by the name of Madame Mary. Many of the city&rsquo;s women would envy her and start false rumors due to their jealousy.&nbsp; The wedding was less than two weeks away and many preparations were being done to Thierry&rsquo;s mansion.&nbsp; Justin was now a fulltime worker in the shipyard, he would always get chills whenever Mr. Thierry would bring his soon to be wife Mary to work with him.&nbsp; Mr. Thierry would always do all the talking and she would say little and always look down, as if she were afraid to speak.&nbsp; One night while Justin was finishing unloading one of the ships he noticed a person standing on the last dock in the port.&nbsp; He looked carefully but could not see clearly, he could not open his eyes all the way due to the cold wind blowing in his face.&nbsp; He yelled from the fourth dock, &ldquo;Hey you over there! You must leave now because Im going to close the gate&rdquo;.&nbsp; No movement at all the person just stared into the moonlight lit ocean listening to the wave&rsquo;s crash against the rocks underneath.&nbsp; Justin got a little closer this time and repeated the same thing, but got the same result, total silence.&nbsp; Furious now he stormed up the last dock grabbed the person and ripped off there scarf and fell back in disbelief.&nbsp; Her fierce blue eyes stared into his brown eyes, her brown blondish hair now flapping in the air as the wind picked up.&nbsp; Justin could barely even move as he stood in shock.&nbsp; &ldquo;Madame Mary im sorry I had no idea that it was you, I would ha&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;If I needed your help would you help me&rdquo; she quickly interrupted.&nbsp; Justin startled by the request, &ldquo;Madame Mary take my coat it&rsquo;s very cold outside you must be cold&rdquo; she answered &ldquo;I did not ask for a coat I asked you a question&rdquo;. Justin was struck by her boldness; he had never heard her talk at all and didn&rsquo;t think she knew how. &ldquo;Do you know why I am marrying Monsieur Thierry?&rdquo;&nbsp; Justin thought to himself then answered &ldquo;because you love him&rdquo;.&nbsp; A small chuckle burst from between her lips &ldquo;Love? What do you know about love&rdquo;?&nbsp; Justin was now confused.&nbsp; She turned her back and began to weep.&nbsp; Justin then put a hand on her shoulder as if to comfort her and asked, &ldquo;Then why marry such a man&rdquo; She quickly threw his hand off her shoulder, &ldquo;because he has power, and power can get you anything&rdquo;.&nbsp; She went on to tell the story about how she met Monsieur Thierry.&nbsp; It happened about four months ago he came to my mill where I was working and asked about me.&nbsp; He found out that I was very poor and had no family.&nbsp; One day while picking up one of his shipments he made me an offer I could not refuse.&nbsp; For me marrying him in return he would promise to find the only family I had left which was my father.&nbsp; Justin interrupted &ldquo;what about your mother?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have no mother&rdquo; she replied &ldquo;she was killed when I was just a child&rdquo;. &nbsp;She now had tears streaming down her face as she spoke &ldquo;I agreed to his deal, because I wanted so desperately to find my family to find my past&rdquo;.&nbsp; She went on, &ldquo;My name was changed because my family had a horrible reputation, so the only way I could find work is by using a fake name&rdquo;.&nbsp; They talked for hours before Mary explained what her plan was.&nbsp; She was going to fake her own death after the wedding and after she found her father.&nbsp; She was going to use Monsieur&rsquo;s powerful influence and money to find her father. Then she would use the fake death, to run off and start a life with her new family.&nbsp; &ldquo;This will take precise planning so you will have to meet me at this location, for if Thierry catches you or me he will kill us both&rdquo;.&nbsp; She then walked towards the gate not even turning around; she had slipped Justin a note with an address on it and a time.&nbsp; Justin was now stuck he had no choice but to follow because he felt her pain; and wanted to help.&nbsp; Night after night Mary would give fake excuses to sneak off to meet Justin in the isolated apartment where they would finalize there plan.&nbsp; But Monsieur Thierry grew suspicious and decided to one night follow her.&nbsp; He followed her to the apartment complex and saw a man waiting for her.&nbsp; He then opened the door she entered he looked around to see if anyone was watching then quickly shut the door.&nbsp; Thierry hid behind a trash can in an alley with rage in his eyes.&nbsp; Thierry starred blankly into the darkness and slid his back down the wall and sat in the dark alley thinking of what he must do.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles Bovary had not eaten for days and was in desperate need for money.&nbsp; He searched every alley trashcan for food and slept under streetlights and on staircases.&nbsp; The storm was getting worse and the snow was falling harder.&nbsp; If Charles was going to survive he would have to find shelter and more food.&nbsp; One night while sleeping on a bench outside of the shipyard a man came to Charles and woke him.&nbsp; Charles blood shot eyes looked tiredly at the man.&nbsp; Thierry spoke, &ldquo;are you hungry old man&rdquo;.&nbsp; Charles nodded and Thierry snapped his fingers and two other men helped Charles up and escorted him to the Estate of Monsieur Thierry.&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles was seated at the end of the long marble table while Thierry was on the other end.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will make this short old man, you are poor and will die unless you eat and find shelter.&nbsp; I can help you out if you do me a favor that I assure you will be rewarded handsomely&rdquo;.&nbsp; Charles squinted not really understanding the question.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will give you fifty thousand franks, twenty five now and twenty five after the job is done&rdquo;.&nbsp; Charles eyes lit up with hope and excitement.&nbsp; Charles finally spoke, &ldquo;what must I do&rdquo;.&nbsp; Thierry then looked down at the table then back at Charles &ldquo; I want you to kill my wife, she has found a new lover and has shown her affection towards another man&rdquo;.&nbsp; Suddenly Charles eyes widened as his mouth dropped open sudden thoughts came to his head.&nbsp; Thoughts of his past, his wife Emma and her affairs with other men erupted anger in Charles.&nbsp; He looked at Thierry with a sharp face and said &ldquo;If I were a rich man Monsieur Thierry, I would do you this favor for free!&rdquo; Thierry just looked at Charles and smiled.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The storm finally showed its ugly side as it swept through the city of Chermon.&nbsp; The grey clouds barricaded the sun from shinning and poured down inches of snow on the city.&nbsp; The streets were deserted not a soul dared to walk at this time.&nbsp; Lucky for Mary she made it to the apartment before the storm begun.&nbsp; But she was now stuck there and leaving would only lead to her death.&nbsp; Charles emerged from the dark alley looking straight forward at the apartment.&nbsp; His eyes firmly fixated on the door, in his hand he held a black pistol with exactly 4 bullets loaded.&nbsp; He tightened his scarf took a deep breath and closed his eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;You said you changed your name right?&rdquo; Charles asked curiously, &ldquo;Yes I did&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well what is your real name then if it is not Madame Mary&rdquo;.&nbsp; Mary then went by the fireplace stared into the hot flames.&nbsp; &ldquo;My real name is Berthe.&nbsp; Berthe Bovary&rdquo;.&nbsp; Justin then stood up as fast as lighting his eyes were blank as if he saw a ghost.&nbsp; He realized that he was looking at the living Emma.&nbsp; The one thing that could heal his guilt was standing in front of him.&nbsp; The winds howled outside and the snow mixed in with chunks of hail.&nbsp; Just as Justin&rsquo;s mouth began to open to speak, the door swung open and three shots were fired.&nbsp; For a moment time had stopped, Justin could not hear anything nothing was moving.&nbsp; When the smoke cleared he saw Berthe holding her chest as blood ran through her fingertips.&nbsp; She looked straight at Charles with eyes of amazement then fell straight to the floor and breathed her last breath.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

  <p align="left" class="style2">3) The Plight Continues</p>
  <p align="left">by Sisi Fiabema<br> 
    <br>
    <em>Beads of sweat stood out on her face, which had turned blue and rigid, as though from the breath of some metallic vapor.  Her teeth chattered, her dilated eyes stared about her vaguely, and her sole answer to questions was a shake of her head; two or three times she even smiled.  Gradually her groans grew louder.  A muffled scream escaped her; she pretended that she was feeling better and that she&rsquo;d soon be getting up.  But she was seized with convulsions.&mdash;<br>
&quot;God!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s horrible!&rdquo; <br>
He flung himself on his knees beside her bed.. <br>
&quot;Speak to me! What did you eat? Answer, for heaven's sake!&quot; <br>
And in his eyes she read a love such as she had never known. <br>
&quot;There&hellip;over there&hellip;&quot; she said in a faltering voice. <br>
He darted to the secretary, broke open the seal and read aloud: &ldquo;No one is to blame...&rdquo;  He stopped, passed his hand over his eyes, read it again.&ldquo;What&hellip;! Help! Help!&rdquo;<br>
Looking up at Emma, </em> &ldquo;Arsenic, you&rsquo;ve eaten arsenic?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&quot;Be calm,&quot; said Homais; &quot;we have only to administer a powerful antidote. What is the poison?&quot; <br>
<br>
&ldquo;Arsenic, she consumed arsenic.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Get her water at once!&rdquo; <br>
<br>
<em>Distraught, faltering, reeling, Charles wandered about the room. He knocked against the furniture, tore his hair, and the chemist had never believed that there could be so terrible a sight. He grabbed Charles by the shoulders, looked him in the eyes and said, &ldquo;Calm down Charles, she is going to make it, but first it is very important </em>that we flush the arsenic out of her body with large amounts of water, I want you to ensure that she drinks as much water is possible while I go get the antidote, can you handle that?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Shaking his head, Charles immediately answered, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Without further delay he dashed out of the room and ordered the maid to bring in a pitcher of water.   He sat beside Emma on the bed, brushing her hair aside, staring at her blue face, <br>
&ldquo;Why, why would you do this?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The druggist returned to the room with the antidote, rushing to Emma&rsquo;s bedside.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Did she spit or cough blood?&quot;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Good, then it is not too late.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Quick, take this.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He handed Emma a small black bottle, opened the cap and urged her to drink it.  She struggled at first not wanting to swallow the medicine, swaying her head from side to side. Charles grabbed the bottle from the druggist and forced it into Emma&rsquo;s mouth. <br>
<br>
&ldquo;Now that she has consumed the antidote. Charles, we must wait.  It will be painful for her, but she will recover.  Ensure that she gets plenty of water.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The next three hours were full of agony for Emma.  She became delirious, apologizing to Charles for everything she had done. <br>
<br>
&ldquo;I am so sorry Charles, you are such a good husband, you did everything in your power to keep me happy, and I trampled on it, all of it!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Hush, you were perfect, you ARE perfect;&rdquo; responded Charles.  &ldquo;You did nothing wrong in my eyes, it was entirely my fault to push you into doing something like this.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Emily tried to explain but the tightness in her throat was too much to bear.  She salivated uncontrollably, praying incessantly. <br>
<br>
&ldquo;God please stop this retched pain, make the pain in my legs and arm subside!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Hush, my dear, save your energy, you&rsquo;ve taken the medicine now, it should only be a matter of time,&rdquo; replied Charles.  &ldquo;The pain in your arms and legs are a result of the arsenic poisoning, once the antidote takes effect, the pain will stop, try to get some rest, and it will be morning soon.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The next day the antidote had finally started to work.  The burning sensation in her throat and stomach had subsided.  Color returned to her face as Charles continued to gently wipe the sweat from her face.  Emma, extremely tired, lay helplessly in her bed.  Charles eyes were heavy now, she was finally able to speak in a faint whisper.<br>
&quot;Bring me the child,&quot; she said, raising herself on her elbow. <br>
<br>
&ldquo;Are you feeling better?&rdquo; asked Charles<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, I am much better now.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The druggist will return at noon, to give you an assessment, and to see what effects the arsenic had on your organs.  Rest now, for you will surely need it, I will call for Berthe.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My dear Charles, must you wait on Homais?  You are just as capable a doctor as he, besides I don&rsquo;t want to wait.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Hush, I do not desire you to wait, but Homais will be sure to cover all parts of the assessment, you cloud my judgment Emma, your beauty alone, even in your current state is enough to bring a man to pieces.  I want the best for you and right now, with the way I feel, I simply cannot provide that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The child was carried in on the servant's arm, poorly dressed, wearing laceless boots.  Caressing her tattered pinafore, Emma was moved with pity at the sight of her daughter, the arm-holes of her pinafore were torn down to the hips; for the maid took no care of her. But she was so sweet, so pretty, she thought to herself,<br>
    &ldquo;How could I have been so blind?  Berthe, my dear Berthe how did I allow myself to ignore you all this time?&rdquo; Berthe looked up at her mother. The entire night she had heard the terrible screams from her mother&rsquo;s room.  She heard the commotion from her father and the druggist and longed to know what was wrong with her mother.<br>
    &ldquo;Maman&hellip;&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;Hush, my love&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    Emma&rsquo;s thoughts were racing now; she sat there in her bed gazing at the beauty hidden behind the hideous rags her daughter wore.  &ldquo;All along I believed you were such an ugly child.&rdquo; She thought to herself, &ldquo;why she is not ugly at all, I simply wished her to be a male I made myself believe she was ugly to excuse my neglect for her, oh but I was wrong.&rdquo; Gently kissing her on her face, she whispered, &ldquo;la beaut&eacute;, la beaut&eacute; pure.&rdquo;  The sight of her daughter and the emotions welling up inside of her were soon interrupted by other thoughts: the reality of her debts. <br>
    &ldquo;Monsieur Lheureux!&rdquo; she gasped.<br>
    <br>
    The thought alone made her quiver.  Immediately she blamed Charles for forcing the antidote down her throat.<br>
    &ldquo;That idiot, if only, he had let me die.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;Moman&hellip;&rdquo;  Berthe whispered to her mother gazing at her intently.<br>
    <br>
    Redirecting her attention to her daughter she held her close, brushing the hair off her face and realizing how beautiful Berthe truly was.  Meanwhile Charles was in the kitchen sitting down facing the window.<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;What an incompetent fool I am. If only I had paid more attention to my medical books, I would have known when Emma took the poison., if only I had been the man she wanted me to be, she would have never been pressured to do such a thing.  It was all my fault, the piano lessons were not enough, all she wanted was for me to be a bit better, to wear cosmetics on my mustache, improve my attire, and write notes on hand.  She was far out of my caliber when we met, I was a fool to believe I could ever measure up to her.  It should have been me who swallowed the arsenic, not her.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    There was a knock at the door it was Justin.  His cheeks were bright red, with drips of sweat oozing from his forehead<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;Come in, oh my, certainly you did not run the entire way here? To what do I owe this visit?&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;Homais informed me of the horrible news of the arsenic poisoning.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    Charles slowly put his head down in shame, believing the poisoning  was his fault, he looked back up at Justin and said,<br>
    &ldquo;Thank you so very much for your visit&hellip;&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    Justin interrupted him saying,<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;It was entirely my fault Monsieur, I had a feeling she was acting a bit strange when she came to my store demanding the arsenic I never would have thought&hellip;.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;No Justin, do not blame yourself, if anyone is to blame it is I, Emma is recovering well, Homias provided her with the antidote, and will be here at noon to accesses her, I will send her your wishes, thank you for your visit.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    With that Justin left, assuring Charles that he will do anything to help if needed.  Less than five minutes later Charles hears another knock at the door, assuming Justin forgot something he runs to the door, it is Homais.<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;Good Afternoon, Charles, how is your wife recovering?&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;She is doing much better today, she is upstairs resting.  I believe she is feeling much better today, her color has returned to her face, her voice is back and the stomach pains have subsided, she is upstairs now if you want to check on her.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    The druggist went to her room and performed his assessment; he found that though Emma will recover the damages done to her organs from the arsenic were intense.  He explained to Charles and Emma that she was at a risk of developing skin cancer.  He also noted that because she shoved the large amount of arsenic into her mouth she suffered from inflammation around her mouth.<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;Inflammation around her mouth.&rdquo;  Repeated Charles, &ldquo;That could lead to keratoses.&rdquo; <br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;Yes Charles it will, it will cause a growth of keratin on her skin, leaving an ugly scar on her face for the rest of her life.  The effects of the arsenic were so intense that she will never be able to fully recover her voice the way it once was.  The arsenic damaged a part of her throat that would cause her to speak in a slight whisper for the rest of her life.  Emma gasped in despair,<br>
    &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be beautiful anymore?&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    Charles reassured her, holding her close.<br>
    &ldquo;You will always be beautiful in my eyes dear.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    Turning aside from him in anger she demanded that both he and Homais leave her room.<br>
    &ldquo;Leave me alone at once; leave me here with the girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My daughter, my dear beloved daughter, you are the only one that can save me from the anguish I am experiencing right now.  We will leave Yonville, just the two of us will travel to Le Courval, and old friend of mine lives there. Be sure not to share this with your father.&rdquo;<br>
    Berthe nodded in agreement.<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;As soon as I get better, I will take you with me.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    Emma&rsquo;s thoughts were becoming clearer now, and for the first time she was sure that her plan to straighten up her debts will surely work.  For the next few weeks she found herself getting close to her dear Berthe.  Charles had promised that he would take care of everything else in the house while she focused on recovering.  He promised her that he would try to do everything within his power to find a good doctor that could take care of her face and voice.  He answered all the calls, and entertained all the guest for Emma made it clear that she wanted to be left alone.  Soon creditors started to contact Charles demanding repayments of loans that Emma had taken out.  Charles attempts to take care of the debts but soon finds out that Emma had taken it upon herself to collect debts his patients had owed him.  He ends up borrowing more money to pay of old debts and resorts to selling his belongings to make up for the funds he lacked.  <br>
    <br>
    Charles finally gets fed up, after months of battling the creditors he realizes that Emma is the reason why they are in so much debt.  He confronts her on the issue:<br>
    &ldquo;Dear, is there anything you would like to tell me about all the money we owe?&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    Emma was surprised her husband asked her, for she was use to Charles being so submissive, she could not bring herself to confess the affairs she was involved in so she told lies upon lies.<br>
  &ldquo;Well the piano lessons were getting boring and were not fulfilling my life, I decided to pick up a new hobby ever since I was a little girl I wanted to take dance lessons, and a woman must be well rounded. Simply being able to play the piano was not enough, I wanted to dance, I wanted to travel, I wanted to act, and I wanted more Charles!  I took it upon myself to borrow the funds from Monsieur Lheurux so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to bother you with petty financial affairs, and now you question me, why all along I had your interests at heart.&rdquo;<br>
  <br>
    Charles believed her, saddened that his plan to provide her with piano lessons were not enough he soon accepted the idea that he should have made provisions for her to take up multiple lessons rather than just one.  He apologized to her assuring her that he will make it up to her by coming up with the funds to cover all of her past expenses.  Over the next two years Berthe was getting older, she was starting to pick up her mother&rsquo;s old habits, turning to romantic novels as entertainment, dressing extravagantly, and disrespecting her father.  Emma had grown quite proud of Berthe and resolved that the answer to all of her problems would ultimately come from Berthe.<br>
    <br>
  &ldquo;Berthe is the answer, all along she was right here in front of me and I never even noticed her beauty.  All I need to do is to change her attire, fix her shoes, wash her face, and pull back her hair.  In a few more years men of high status will be asking for her hand in marriage.  None of them will be worthy of her. She will marry a gentleman with patent leather boots and white cravats.  His wealth would far surpass that of Rodolphe&rsquo;s, she will have a candlelight wedding at night.  She will become a wealthy woman and will have me to thank for her success.&quot;</p>

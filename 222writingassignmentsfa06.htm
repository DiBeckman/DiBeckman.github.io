</a>This site is very cool because it has sound clips and draws from a wide range of speeches, movies, and more to illustrate the Figures of Speech. For example, see and listen to quotes from Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln, and Neil Armstrong on the page about antitheses: <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/figures/antithesis.htm">http://www.americanrhetoric.com/figures/antithesis.htm</a></font></span></p>

1) Read <em>Essay on Man</em> and write a page  to turn in about your stanza to turn in. What is it about? Give a one sentence summary. Answer the 4 questions from Shannon. Also, what are the key words and images in the stanza? How does the stanza connect with the ideas of the Enlightenment we've discussed? What is the attitude of the narrator? What is the role of nature, especially animals, if any appear in your stanza?</p>

1) 
</span>Your first WebCT post is due at midnight on Monday. </p>

<p class="style2">4) Consider bookmarking an online dictionary or two to make it easy to look up words you don't know. If you are doing the Reading Notebook, you can print out the definitions to include in your notebook. <br>
    <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/">http://dictionary.reference.com/</a><br>

<p class="style2"><span class="style8">Class 5 (Voltaire, Lecture 2) <span class="style13">due Friday, Sept. 1 </span><br>
<span class="style4">Discuss the following question after you do the reading. Is Eldorado a genuine utopia or (in one critic's words) &quot;a colossal bore&hellip;satirized by Voltaire as foolish and futile&quot;? Which specific behaviors or institutions show us that Voltaire wants us to see Eldorado as utopic?  Does Voltaire have a philosophical lesson in mind or is it pure satire? Or both?</span></span> How does it correspond to your view of Utopia? <span class="style4">Quote from the text with examples to support your answers.</span></p>
<p class="style2">See Lecture Notes on <a href="222dulce.html">Dulce et utile</a> </p>
<p class="style2">The first original contribution post&mdash;on Pope&mdash;is due Friday at midnight. You will have many authors to choose from to do your required 13 posts (7 original contributions and 6 responses), but I encourage you to get in the habit of posting by starting with Pope or Voltaire. For an original contribution post, make a point or develop an argument of at least 7 lines based on something you read, learned or thought while reading <em>An Essay on Man</em>. It can be helpful to ask a question or make a provocative statement for your classmates to respond to. Did something in your homework get praise or a lot of comment from me? If so, it might be the basis of a good post. </p>

<p class="style2">Coming up: peer review draft of <a href="222Paper1-05.html">Paper 1</a> is due next <span class="style13">Wednesday, Oct. 4. <span class="style4">Read about it</span>. </span>Think about it.</p>
<p class="style25">FORMALIST CRITICISM: <span class="style4"><br>
</span><span class="style3">&bull; How do various elements such as characterization create and reinforce the work's underlying meaning? For example, is Abb&eacute; Bournisien's role, not to disrespect, but to call attention to the failure of organized religion to meet people's needs? <br>
&bull; Why did Flaubert pick <em>Madame Bovary</em> as a title? </span></p>
<p class="style25">SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM<br>
  &nbsp; Marxist Criticism:<br>
  <span class="style4">&bull; What character do you think portrays the failure of the bourgeoisie the most? Which characters contribute to it?<br>
  &bull; Money plays an extremely important role in the characters' lives in <em>Madame Bovary</em>. How do economic conditions relate to the characters' attitudes and conditions in the story?<br>
&bull; How did Madame Bovary's social and economic status affect her abilty to borrow money?</span><br>
<span class="style4">&bull; What is Flaubert trying to tell the reader about the current social structure in France. Does he agree with having class distinctions or is he suggesting that there needs to be reform?<br>
&bull; Explain the differences and similarities between Charles, Charles' father, Charles' mother and Emma in regard to their perspective on economic and social forces that affect their lives.</span></p>
<p class="style25">SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM<br>
  &nbsp; Feminist Criticism: <span class="style4"><br>
  &bull; How do the relationships between men and women in <em>Madame Bovary</em> compare to those of the Enlightenment and Romanticism, especially in considering  the theme of power? </span><br>
  <span class="style4">&bull; How does Emma's status in society as a woman drive her actions? </span><br>
  <span class="style4">&bull; How did Flaubert use Emma to show his feelings about a woman's role in society? Emma is seen as provocative, childish, and only good at seduction. Are these Flaubert's feelings or society's feelings at the time?<br>
  &bull; Emma always seems to think that &quot;the grass is always green on the other side of the fence.&quot; Does her attitude cause the conflicts she has with Charles? Does Charles have any clue about Emma and her love for L&eacute;on and now for Rodolphe? Will Emma's eloping with Rodolphe really solve the problemss she has with being happy in love, or is she just searching for something she will never find?<br>
  &bull; What are some examples of the gender roles in the story, and how do they affect the relationships between the characters?<br>
  &bull; What about Emma is different from the typical lady of her rank and time period, and what statement, if any, is Flaubert making through her character? </span><br>
  <span class="style4">&bull; How does the feminist movement stand in Emma's walks of life? Does Emma reject these roles and ideals?<br>
&bull; How are Emma's and the elder Madame Bovary's lives portrayed in <em>Madame Bovary</em>? Does Emma accept or reject her role as Charles' wife? How?<br>
&bull; How is Emma's marriage to Charles representative of realism and how does her relationship with him compare to her relationships with the other men in her life: her father, L&eacute;on, and Rodophe?<br>
&bull; Why does Emma feel so repressed by her gender instead of empowered by it?</span></p>
<p class="style25">CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICSM: <span class="style4"><br>
&bull; What elements of <em>Madame Bovary </em>make this a realist work? What parallels are there between this story and the cultural and historical aspect of its era? </span><br>
  <span class="style4">&bull; Even though Charles is not the best at his profession, he is a doctor. Why is this seen as a lowly profession during this time period, even those it is a respectable one in modern times?<br>
&bull; As Emma begins her fantasies of true love and romance at an early age in the convent, has she set herself up to be unsatisfied by constantly dreaming up &quot;fairy tale&quot; love affairs? After being married and carrying on two &quot;love&quot; affairs, she remains discontent, leaving the reader to wonder if she will ever stop her flightiness accept the path her life has followed.  <br>
  &bull; Emma wanted so badly to move up into the life of the upper class with all the fine dresses, balls and plays. Were there cultural and/or social barriers to her living a life that she would have been more happy with or was Charles the main barrier?<br>
  &bull; What does Flaubert's attack on romanticism in Madame Bovary say about his personal views of life and the society in which he lives?<br>
  &bull; How does Emma's character compare with the ideals of the Cult of Domesticity and the ideals of womanhood in the 19th century?</span><br>
  <span class="style4">&bull; What societal issues were raised when people read about Emma Bovary and her relationships with several men? How did society's views and expectations begin to change at this time?<br>
&bull; How does <em>Madame Bovary</em> reflect the time period (mid-1800's) in which it was written? <br>
&bull; How does Emma's education or lack thereof ultimately lead to her destruction?<br>
&bull; How much blame do you impute to the characters, and how much do you lay at the feet of that culture's social norms and mores? 
<br>
&bull; Was Emma the symbol of the struggle of the Bourgeoisie to gain wealth and to escape the lonesome middle class? Was Emma used by Flaubert to make fun or criticize the Bourgeoisie's ignorance and failure to live a life beneficial to society?</span><br>
<span class="style4">&bull; How does the time period in which the story is based affect the characters' lives differently than if they lived today </span></p>
<p class="style25">PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM: <span class="style4"><br>
&bull; What do Emma's emotions and behaviors reveal about her psychological state? What is her personality type?<br>
  &bull; Does Emma have actual psychological problems that have provoked her behavior, such as lust, shopping sprees, hair colors/cuts? Is Flaubert hinting at his own psychological state through the flaws and problems of the various characters, such as lust, lying, failure?<br>
  &bull; Does Flaubert present desires of the characterss consciously or unconsciously? 
</span> <br>
<span class="style4">&bull; How does the work reflect Flaubert's personal feelings on the situation in society and what symbolism does he use to show this situation?<br>
&bull; What are some of the psychological issues, in primary characters, that are obvious to the reader but not to the other characters? 
<br>
&bull; Because Flaubert is writing about unstable, overbearing and frail women as the center of his story, what does this say about Flaubert's relationships with women in the past and the present? What events in his life could have caused Flaubert to have low respect for women in his life? What might lead the reader to think that this disrespect might have stemmed from someone in Flaubert's life? </span></p>
<p class="style25">READER RESPONSE CRITICISM: <span class="style4"><br>
  &bull; What was your reaction to Emma's decision to have an affair with L&eacute;on in Part 3? Why?
  <br>
&bull; Which character do you most relate to? How did this affect the way you view that character and/or his/her role in the story? <br>
&bull; With which character do the readers sympathize with the most? <br>
&bull; As a reader, how do you respond to this story? Also how you do respond to the life-line and life which Emma is living?<br>
&bull; Is Emma unrealistic in her desire for personal fulfillment and happiness? 
How do your expectations of personal fulfillment affect your reading of <em>Madame Bovary</em>? How do you  judge the character's actions and decisions based on your own moral/ ethical views?</span><br>

Three characters struggle for power in Pirandello's play: the producer, the father and the stepdaughter.

<p class="style2"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some helpful background to understand the family drama which precedes Act 1: <br>
</font>Father, an intellectual, marries a lower class woman; they have a son, but the Father becomes bored with his wifeand sends her off to live with his male secretary. Father keeps custody of the Son, who is raised by a wet nurse and grows up to be very resentful. The wife obediently leaves the family home and she and the former secretary have 3 more children; the Father watches over them, but eventually they move away; the stepfather dies, and the wife and three children move back to the original town without telling the Father. Mother and Stepdaughter take jobs with a dressmaker, Madame Pace, who runs a call-girl service: Mother as a seamstress, Stepdaughter as a prostitute, who is ultimately hired by the Father. Family is reunited: explosive conflict.</p>

  1. What purpose does the &quot;play within a play&quot; serve? Are you familiar with other plays that use this technique?</span></span><br>
For example, <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em> by Shakespeare, <em>Kiss Me Kate</em>, <em>The Producers, In the Sandbox </em>by Edward Albee, <em>The Purple Rose of Cairo</em> by Woody Allen, <em>The Last Metro</em> by Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut&hellip;  </p>
<p class="style2">2. Comparison with <em>Hedda Gabler</em>. A critic writes: &quot;Hedda's idealized version of her father deforms her life.&quot; How does Ibsen dramatize General Gabler's enduring control over his daughter? How would you compare the relationship between the Father and the Stepdaughter in <em>Six Characters is Search of an Author</em>?&quot; Or consider Emma and her father. What about the absence of father figures in the <em>Importance of Being Earnest</em>? </p>

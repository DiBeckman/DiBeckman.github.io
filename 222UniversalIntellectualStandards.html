<p><strong>Questions Using the Elements of Thought<br />
1. Purpose:</strong> Is the purpose well stated? Is it clear and justifiable?<br />
<strong>2. Question</strong>: Is the question clear and unbiased? Does the formulation of the question do justice to the complexity of the matter? Are the question and purpose directly related to each other?<br />
<strong>3. Information</strong>: Does the writer cite relevant evidence, experiences, and/or information essential to the issue? Is the information accurate? Does the writer address the complexities of the issue?<br />
<strong>4. Concepts:</strong> Does the writer clarify key concepts where necessary?<br />
<strong>5. Assumptions</strong>: Does the writer use questionable assumptions without addressing the problems that might be inherent in those assumptions?<br />
<strong>6. Inference:</strong> Does the writer develop a line of reasoning explaining well how s/he is arriving at his/her conclusion?<br />
<strong>7. Point of view:</strong> Does the writer show sensitivity to alternative relevant points of view or lines of reasoning?<br />
<strong>8. Implications:</strong> Does the writer show sensitivity to the implications and consequences of the position s/he is taking?</p>

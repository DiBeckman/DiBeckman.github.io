&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~ George Eliot<br />
<br />
In the arithmetic of love, one plus one equals everything, and two minus one equals nothing.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~ Mignon McLaughlin</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~ Pearl S. Buck</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp; Love works in miracles every day: such as weakening the strong, and stretching the weak; making fools of the wise, and wise men of fools; favouring the passions, destroying reason, and in a word, turning everything topsy-turvy.<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~ Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~ Robert Browning</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp; Love is a thing, well, its kind of like quicksand: <br />
  The more you are in it, the deeper you sink. <br />
  And when it hits you, you've just got to fall.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~ UB40</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp; Love is the expansion of two natures in such fashion<br />
  that each include the other,<br />
  each is enriched by the other.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~ Felix Adler</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp; Think about it, there must be higher love<br />

  but in looking together in the same direction.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~ Antoine de Saint-Exupery</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp; Romance has been elegantly defined as the offspring of fiction and love.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~ Benjamin Disraeli</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp; Find the person who will love you because of your differences and<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~ Leo Buscaglia</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody will ever win the battle of the sexes.<br />
  There's too much fraternizing with the enemy.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~ Henry Kissinger</p>

  this is to have succeeded.<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~ Thomas Trahern</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~ Leo Buscaglia</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp; It is best to love wisely, no doubt;<br />

  not to be able to love at all.<br />

<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp; Love is a mutual self-giving which ends in self-recovery.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~ Fulton J. Sheen</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp; We find rest in those we love, and we provide a resting place<br />
  in ourselves for those who love us.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~ Saint Bernard of Clairvaux</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp; Love grows by giving. The love we give away is the only love we keep. The only way to retain love is to give it away.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~ Elbert Hubbard</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp; The most powerful symptom of love is a tenderness which becomes at times almost insupportable.<br />

<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp; May no gift be too small to give,<br />
  nor too simple to receive,<br />
  which is wrapped in thoughtfulness<br />
  and tied with love.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~ L.O. Baird</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~ Helen Hayes<br />

<br />
Albert Einstein:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How on earth are you ever going to explain in terms of chemistry and physics so important a biological phenomenon as first love?</p>
<p class="style1">Alfred Adler:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We only regard those unions as real examples of love and real marriages in which a fixed and unalterable decision has been taken. If men or women contemplate an escape, they do not collect all their powers for the task. In none of the serious and important tasks of life do we arrange such a &quot;getaway.&quot; We cannot love and be limited.</p>
<p class="style1">Alfred Tennyson:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hold it true, whate'er befall;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel it, when I sorrow most;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tis better to have loved and lost<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than never to have loved at all.</p>
<p class="style1">Allan K. Chalmers:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Grand essentials of happiness are: something to do, something to love, and something to hope for.</p>
<p class="style1">Ambrose Bierce:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love: a temporary insanity, curable by marriage.</p>
<p class="style1">Amy Bloom:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love at first sight is easy to understand; it's when two people have been looking at each other for a lifetime that it becomes a miracle.</p>
<p class="style1">Amy Tan:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am like a falling star who has finally found her place next to another in a lovely constellation, where we will sparkle in the heavens forever.</p>
<p class="style1">Anais Nin:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don't know how to replenish its source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of witherings, of tarnishings.</p>
<p class="style1">Ann Landers:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have love in your life it can make up for a great many things you lack. If you don't have it, no matter what else there is, it's not enough.</p>
<p class="style1">Anne Morrow Lindbergh:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Him that I love, I wish to be free -- even from me.</p>
<p class="style1">Antoine de Saint-Exupery:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love does not consist of gazing at each other, but in looking together in the same direction.</p>
<p class="style1">Barbara De Angelis:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love is a choice you make from moment to moment.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver.</p>
<p class="style1">Bayard Rustin:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I say I love Eastland, it sounds preposterous -- a man who brutalizes people. But you love him or you wouldn't be here. You're going to Mississippi to create social change -- and you love Eastland in your desire to create conditions which will redeem his children. Loving your enemy is manifest in putting your arms not around the man but around the social situation, to take power from those who misuse it -- at which point they can become human too.</p>
<p class="style1">Bayard Taylor:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love thee, I love but thee<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a love that shall not die<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the sun grows cold,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the stars grow old...</p>
<p class="style1">Bertrand Russell:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three passions have governed my life:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The longings for love, the search for knowledge,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And unbearable pity for the suffering of [humankind].</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love brings ecstasy and relieves loneliness.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the union of love I have seen<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a mystic miniature the prefiguring vision<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the heavens that saints and poets have imagined.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With equal passion I have sought knowledge.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have wished to understand the hearts of [people].<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have wished to know why the stars shine.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love and knowledge led upwards to the heavens,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But always pity brought me back to earth;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cries of pain reverberated in my heart<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of children in famine, of victims tortured<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And of old people left helpless.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I long to alleviate the evil, but I cannot,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I too suffer.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This has been my life; I found it worth living.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adapted</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sense of duty is useful in work, but offensive in personal relations. People wish to be liked, not be endured with patient resignation.</p>
<p class="style1">Bible:</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love is patient, love is kind.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not rude, it is not self-seeking.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love never fails.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I Corinthians 13:4-8</p>
<p class="style1">Blaise Pascal:</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The heart has its reasons which reason knows not of. (<em>Le c&oelig;ur a ses raisons que la raison ne conna&icirc;t point</em>.)</p>
<p class="style1">C.S. Lewis:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why love if losing hurts so much? We love to know that we are not alone.</p>
<p class="style1">Carl Jung:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where love rules, there is no will to power; and where power predominates, there love is lacking. The one is the shadow of the other.</p>
<p class="style1">Carter Heyward:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love, like truth and beauty, is concrete. Love is not fundamentally a sweet feeling; not, at heart, a matter of sentiment, attachment, or being &quot;drawn toward.&quot; Love is active, effective, a matter of making reciprocal and mutually beneficial relation with one's friends and enemies.</p>
<p class="style1">Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve:</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell me who admires and loves you,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I will tell you who you are.</p>
<p class="style1">Chaucer:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For there is one thing I can safely say: that those bound by love must obey each other if they are to keep company long. Love will not be constrained by mastery; when mastery comes, the God of love at once beats his wings, and farewell -- he is gone. Love is a thing as free as any spirit; women naturally desire liberty, and not to be constrained like slaves; and so do men, if I shall tell the truth.</p>
<p class="style1">Dale Evans:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every time we love, every time we give, it's Christmas.</p>
<p class="style1">Don Byas:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You call it madness, but I call it love.</p>
<p class="style1">E.M. Forster:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only connect! That was the whole of her sermon. Only connect the prose and the passion, and both will be exalted, and human love will be seen at its height. Live in fragments no longer. Only connect...</p>
<p class="style1">Ecclesiastes:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For everything there is a season,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a time for every matter under heaven:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A time to be born, and a time to die;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A time to kill, and a time to heal;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A time to break down, and a time to build up;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A time to weep, and a time to laugh;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A time to mourn, and a time to dance;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A time to throw away stones, and a time to gather stones together;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A time to embrace, And a time to refrain from embracing;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A time to seek, and a time to lose;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A time to keep, and a time to throw away;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A time to tear, and a time to sew;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A time to keep silence, and a time to speak;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A time to love, and a time to hate,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A time for war, and a time for peace.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ecclesiastes 3:1-8</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1">Edna St. Vincent Millay:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life is a quest and love a quarrel ...</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love humanity but I hate people.</p>
<p class="style1">Elbert Hubbard:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The love we give away is the only love we keep.</p>
<p class="style1">Elie Wiesel:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Oct. 1986) </p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friendship marks a life even more deeply than love. Love risks degenerating into obsession, friendship is never anything but sharing.</p>
<p class="style1">Elizabeth Barret Browning:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whoso loves, believes the impossible.</p>
<p class="style1">Ella Wheeler Wilcox:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All love that has not friendship for its base,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is like a mansion built upon the sand.</p>
<p class="style1">Emily Dickinson:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That Love is all there is,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is all we know of Love.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love&mdash;is anterior to Life&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Posterior&mdash;to Death&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Initial of Creation, and<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Exponent of Earth&mdash;</p>
<p class="style1">Who has not found the heaven below<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will fail of it above.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God's residence is next to min,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His furniture is love.</p>
<p class="style1">Emma Goldman:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Free love? As if love is anything but free! Man has bought brains, but all the millions in the world have failed to buy love. Man has subdued bodies, but all the power on earth has been unable to subdue love. Man has conquered whole nations, but all his armies could not conquer love. Man has chained and fettered the spirit, but he has been utterly helpless before love. High on a throne, with all the splendor and pomp his gold can command, man is yet poor and desolate, if love passes him by. And if it stays, the poorest hovel is radiant with warmth, with life and color. Thus love has the magic power to make of a beggar a king. Yes, love is free; it can dwell in no other atmosphere.</p>
<p class="style1">Erich Fromm:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Infantile love follows the principle: &quot;I love because I am loved.&quot;<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mature love follows the principle: &quot;I am loved because I love.&quot;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immature love says: &quot;I love you because I need you.&quot;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mature love says: &quot;I need you because I love you.&quot;</p>
<p class="style1">Ernest Becker:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we understand that man is the only animal who must create meaning, who must open a wedge into neutral nature, we already understand the essence of love. Love is the problem of an animal who must find life, create a dialogue with nature in order to experience his own being.</p>
<p class="style1">Euripides:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is not a lover who does not love forever.</p>
<p class="style1">Felix Adler:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love is the expansion of two natures in such fashion that each include the other, each is enriched by the other.</p>
<p class="style1">Francis David:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need not think alike to love alike.</p>
<p class="style1">Franklin P. Jones:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love doesn't make the world go 'round; love is what makes the ride worthwhile.</p>
<p class="style1">Friedrich Nietzsche:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages.</p>
<p class="style1">Georg C. Lichtenberg:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love is blind, but marriage restores its sight.</p>
<p class="style1">George MacDonald:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be trusted is a greater compliment than to be loved.</p>
<p class="style1">George Sand:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is only one happiness in life, to love and be loved.</p>
<p class="style1">George Santayana:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love is only half the illusion; the lover, but not his love, is deceived.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Life of Reason, 1905-1906 </p>
<p class="style1">Goethe:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be loved for what one is, is the greatest exception. The great majority love in others only what they lend him, their own selves, their version of him.</p>
<p class="style1">H. L. Mencken:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be in love is merely to be in a state of perceptual anesthesia -- to mistake an ordinary young man for a Greek god or an ordinary young woman for a goddess.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prejudices, 1919 </p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1">HH the Dalai Lama:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Responsibility does not only lie with the leaders of our countries or with those who have been appointed or elected to do a particular job. It lies with each of us individually. Peace, for example, starts within each one of us. When we have inner peace, we can be at peace with those around us.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we feel love and kindness toward others, it not only makes others feel loved and cared for, but it helps us also to develop inner happiness and peace.</p>
<p class="style1">Han Suyin [Elizabeth Comber]:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...love from one being to another can only be that two solitudes come nearer, recognize and protect and comfort each other.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. 1917 Chinese writer and physician </p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1">Hazrat Inayat Khan:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sage said, &quot;The best thing is not to hate anyone, only to love. That is the only way out of it. As soon as you have forgiven those whom you hate, you have gotten rid of them. Then you have no reason to hate them; you just forget.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spiritual Dimensions of Psychology </p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1">Helen Keller:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever been at sea in a dense fog, when it seemed as if a tangible white darkness shut you in and the great ship, tense and anxious, groped her way toward the shore with plummet and sounding-line, and you waited with beating heart for something to happen? I was like that ship before my education began, only I was without compass or sounding line, and no way of knowing how near the harbor was. &quot;Light! Give me light!&quot; was the wordless cry of my soul, and the light of love shone on me in that very hour.</p>
<p class="style1">Henri Nouwen:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your body needs to be held and to hold, to be touched and to touch. None of these needs is to be despised, denied, or repressed. But you have to keep searching for your body's deeper need, the need for genuine love. Every time you are able to go beyond the body's superficial desires for love, you are bringing your body home and moving toward integration and unity.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I know what love is, it is because of you.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know quite well, deep within you, that there is only a single magic, a single power, a single salvation...and that is called loving. Well, then, love your suffering. Do not resist it, do not flee from it. It is your aversion that hurts, nothing else.</p>

<p class="style1">Mitsugi Saotome:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you were all alone in the universe with no one to talk to, no one with which to share the beauty of the stars, to laugh with, to touch, what would be your purpose in life? It is other life, it is love, which gives your life meaning. This is harmony. We must discover the joy of each other, the joy of challenge, the joy of growth.</p>
<p class="style1">Mohandas K. Gandhi:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hatred ever kills, love never dies. Such is the vast difference between the two. What is obtained by love is retained for all time. What is obtained by hatred proves a burden in reality for it increases hatred.</p>

<p class="style1">Nathaniel Hawthorne:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is to the credit of human nature, that, except where its selfishness is brought into play, it loves more readily than it hates.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved. Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion. It merely intensifies it. We can have but one great experience at best, and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible.<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the mother of Art,<br />

    <strong>First love </strong><br />
  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/mind/articles/emotions/teenagers/love.shtml">http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/mind/articles/emotions/teenagers/love.shtml</a></p>
<p>Everyone remembers their first love. Few experiences will ever be as intense and overwhelming as your first crush.<br />
  When teenagers develop a sense of extraordinary closeness with another person, the experience has echoes of the close contact between mother and child in infancy.<br />
  Falling in love as a teenager is more intense than the experience in adulthood. But these early relationships usually burn out quickly. One survey showed that at age 15, dating relationships last an average of only three to four months.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Love on the brain</strong><br />
  Researchers have identified pathways in the brain which light up when teenagers are in love. Falling in love seems to have a similar effect on the brain as using cocaine. It's so pleasurable it's almost like an addiction.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Brief loves</strong><br />
  Researchers have identified three phases of love. The initial physical response is 'lust'. The falling in love is called 'attraction'. The emotional commitment, required to make relationships last in the long term, is known as 'attachment'.<br />
  Teenagers seem to experience the attraction phase more strongly than adults, but their failure to enter the attachment phase may be to blame for the short-term nature of their relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons in love</strong><br />
  However short-lived it might turn out to be, an experience of passionate love can quickly become the most important thing in a young person's life. Teenagers in love spend endless hours talking, either on the phone or face to face.</p>
<div><br />
  This intimacy teaches them about their own identity, simply through becoming close to someone else. Intimacy also involves openness, sharing and trust, so it also contributes to maturity. </div>

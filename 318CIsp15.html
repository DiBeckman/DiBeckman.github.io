<li>
<span class="red">You are required to watch  the films on the syllabus in their entirety. </span>A few will be screened in class, but you will see the majority outside of class. For some classes, you will have your choice of film.
</ul>
<strong>
  Resources available in DH Hill</strong>: Textbooks and films are on reserve at the Circulation desk. I encourage you to watch the films with other students from the class whenever possible. There are many <a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/studyrooms/getaroom.php">rooms</a> you can reserve at the library. 
  <p><strong>Others source for films:</strong> In addition, many films are available to stream online: try Amazon, Netflix, iTunes, Hulu, Hulu Plus, YouTube, etc. Corrigan (132-34) lists other resources.  Hulu Plus has recently purchased the Criterion collection, so you will find many of the most important older films on that site.  Information and clips from Singerman's<span class="text"> Apprentissage</span> are available on the book's <a href="http://franklin.davidson.edu/lrc/french/frenchcinema/index.html">website</a>.</p>
<h2>COURSE DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>In this course we will explore the heritage of the French cinema through watching, reading, 
  discussing, and writing about some of the major films 
  from the nineteenth through twenty-first centuries. We will also pay attention 
  to the political and cultural contexts of these works. Students will &quot;engage the human experience through the interpretation of human culture [and] become aware of the act of interpretation itself as a critical form of knowing in the humanities.&quot; (<a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/uap/academic-standards/gep/courselists/humanities/requirement.html">General Education Program</a>, NCSU)</p>
<h2>LEARNING GOALS</h2>
<p>By the end of the course you should be able to:</p><ul>
<li>explain the characteristics of the major periods of French cinema from its invention to the present day comparing  &quot;ideas, values, images, cultural artifacts, economic structures, technological developments, [and] attitudes.&quot; (<a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/uap/academic-standards/gep/courselists/humanities/requirement.html">General Education Program</a>, NCSU)</li>
<li>describe how a film reflects its historical context.</li>
<li>identify the narrative and cinematic devices employed in a film, such 
  as theme, point of view, mise-en sc&egrave;ne, and composition, and relate them to the content of the 
  film. See  Glossaries in <span class="text">Apprentissage </span>(3-7) and <span class="text">A Short Guide </span>(180-183) for definitions of these terms. </li>
<li>discuss, orally and in writing, selected French films and their continuing 
  aesthetic validity or challenge.</li>
<li>write a coherent essay on given topics about these films and their contexts, 
  supporting arguments with evidence. The learning objective is for students to &quot;make academic arguments about the human experience using reasons and evidence for supporting those reasons that are appropriate to the humanities.&quot; (<a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/uap/academic-standards/gep/courselists/humanities/requirement.html">General Education Program</a>, NCSU).</li></ul>
<h2>GRADING</h2>
<p>Your grade in this course will be computed as follows: <br />
  <strong>Class Work</strong>: Attendance &amp; Participation (25%), Homework  (75%)<strong>: <span class="red">25%</span></strong><br />
  <strong>Midterm: <span class="red">15%</span></strong><br />
  <strong>Paper- journal entries:</strong><strong> <span class="red">10%</span></strong><br />
  <strong>Film Presentation: <span class="red">15%<br />
  </span>Final Paper: <span class="red">15%</span></strong><br />
  <strong>Final Exam: <span class="red">20%</span></strong><br /></p>
<p>There will be plus/minus grading in this class. The scale will be as follows:<br />
  A+ = 97.0-100, A = 93.0-96.9, A- = 90.0-92.9, <br />
  B+ = 87.0-89.9, B = 83.0-86.9, B- = 80.0-82.9, <br />
  C+ = 77.0-79.9, C = 73.0-76.9, C- = 70.0-72.9, <br />
  D+ = 67.0-69.9, D = 63.0-66.9, D- = 60.0-62.9, <br />
F = 59.9 and below.</p>
<p>This is an academically rigorous  class with a lot of film viewing outside of class as well as daily writing assignments. I  expect a lot from  students and will do whatever I can to help you succeed. I will do my best to keep the class atmosphere creative, lively, and accepting of your best efforts. Keep up with the work and participate actively in class. Both <strong>effort</strong> and <strong>ability</strong> will be rewarded.</p>
<h2>ATTENDANCE REGULATIONS &amp; LATE ASSIGNMENTS</h2>
<p>Attendance is <strong>required</strong> and will be taken daily. You are expected to arrive on time to class. Repeated tardiness will 
  affect your grade: two tardies will count as one absence. You are permitted one absence with no penalty. Each additional 
  absence will reduce your class participation grade by one step (from A to A-, 
  from B+ to B, etc.). See me as soon as possible after an absence and provide 
  a written excuse to be accepted at my discretion (in case of illness, injury, 
  death or illness in the family, university duties, court attendance, or religious 
  observance). Save 
  your absences for emergencies. <strong>Excessive absences may lead to an F for the course</strong>. </p>
<p>If you need to miss a class, let me know 
  in person or by email before the class meeting, if possible.  Upon your return 
to class, you are responsible for all work missed and for any assignments announced during your absence. If you ask me if you missed anything, <a href="http://principles.ou.edu/did_i_miss_anything.htm">here</a> is the reply I will be tempted to send you. <strong>No late work will receive full credit unless an excused absence has been accepted by the instructor</strong>. These policies are based on Departmental and <a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03">University Attendance Regulations</a>.</p>
<h2>INCOMPLETE GRADES</h2>
<p>Incomplete grades will be given only when a student cannot complete the course work due to unforeseeable circumstances beyond his/her control and has done most of the course work. In the case of an excused absence, students need to set up a timetable with me to complete the missing assignments. </p>
<h2>HOMEWORK</h2>
<p>Students view and write about assigned films (see <a href="318sysp15.html">Syllabus</a>) <strong> before</strong> coming to class. The informal daily writing assignments  are posted  on the <a href="318devoirssp15.html">Les Devoirs</a> page. They do not appear on the Syllabus. You may type or handwrite your daily writing assignment.<strong> Double space or skip lines</strong>, so that I can read them easily and  there will be room for my comments. Please include an assignment heading (for example, <em>La Nuite am&eacute;ricaine</em>, <em>La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc</em>). You may also wish to copy and paste the prompt as a heading if you are typing the assignment. If you use a spiral notebook, please remove the little bits of paper on the left-hand edge before turning in your homework. Feel free to use recycled paper. I appreciate legibility and ecological efforts!</p>
<p>Vocabulaire utile pour <a href="318VocabulaireOpinion.html">exprimer une opinion</a>; <a href="articulation.html">Ecrire</a> en fran&ccedil;ais; Correction <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~dsbeckma/110CorrectionSymbols.html">symbols and abbreviations</a>. <a href="http://www.laits.utexas.edu/tex/gr/">Site</a> g&eacute;nial pour la r&eacute;vision de la grammaire.</p>
<p>  In your daily writing assignments, as on longer papers, be sure to cite your secondary sources. Not citing them can lead to a failing grade on the assignment or in the course. See the section on the <strong>Academic Integrity </strong> below. </p>
<h2>WRITTEN WORK</h2>
<p>Please <strong>skip lines</strong> on all compositions and longer written assignments whether handwritten or typed. Vocabulaire utile pour <a href="318VocabulaireOpinion.html">exprimer une opinion</a>; <a href="articulation.html">Ecrire</a> en fran&ccedil;ais; Correction <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~dsbeckma/110CorrectionSymbols.html">symbols and abbreviations</a></p>
<p> <strong>Do</strong> use regular or online dictionaries to check gender, spelling, and find French 
  or English equivalents for individual words or idiomatic expressions (for example: <em>tourner un film</em> = to make a film). Bookmark these sites:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.wordreference.com/">http://www.wordreference.com/</a> (my favorite French-English online dictionary; great for idioms)<br />
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/">http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/ </a>(my favorite French-French online dictionary)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.oxfordlanguagedictionaries.com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/"> oxfordlanguagedictionaries</a> (Sign-on via NCSU Libraries.)</li>
  <li>The University of Chicago site has a handy <a href="http://machaut.uchicago.edu/conjugator">French verb conjugator</a></li>
</ul>
<p>However, do <b>NOT</b> use online translators for complete sentences in written 
  assignments. The results are poor and will violate <strong>Academic Integrity</strong> (see below).</p>
<h2>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY</h2> 
<p>The Foreign Language Department takes the University Policy on Academic Integrity 
  very seriously. An atmosphere of trust, honesty and respect  fosters 
  educational progress and success. Please do not give me any reason to be suspicious 
of your honesty. I ask each student  to fill out and return the <a href="AcademicIntegrityPledge.html">FLF 318 Academic Integrity Form</a>. Please read it carefully before signing. </p>
<p> You are expected to do your own work on all class assignments, papers, 
  and exams, unless it is a designated group assignment. You must not incorporate others&#146; ideas or words and present them as your 
  own&#151;this is called plagiarism. Whether you take ideas (verbatim or just 
  as an idea) from books, the internet, or other sources does not matter; you 
  need to acknowledge their source if they are not your own. <strong>Let me warn you especially 
    about the temptations of the internet</strong>. There are appropriate and inappropriate uses of sites such as Wikipedia in this class. Not citing your source is <strong class="red">always</strong> inappropriate, and may result in a failing grade on the assignment or for the course.</p>
 
<p>Violations of academic integrity (plagiarism, cheating, etc.) <strong>will be prosecuted</strong>  according to <a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01">NC State&#146;s Code of Student Conduct</a>. <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/student_services/student_discipline/POL11.35.1.php"></a></p>
<h2>PARTICIPATION</h2>
<p class="red">Cell phones and mobile devices must be silent and put away during class. No texting, please. Violations will affect your participation grade.</p>
<p>The attendance/ participation portion of the Class Work grade will be determined using the following criteria and attendance requirements above. You will also have the opportunity to fill out a self-evaluation of your participation in class. </p>
<p>A = Student comes to class prepared, brings proper materials, and arrives on time. Student is attentive and frequently volunteers to participate. Student is actively involved in all class activities and stays on task in group work. Any questions and comments are pertinent. <br />
  B = Student is  usually prepared. Student is attentive, participates in all activities, and volunteers from time to time. Student asks only pertinent questions. <br />
  C= Student shows evidence of being unprepared and may do homework, consult the newspaper, or text during class. Student may arrive late or leave early. Student volunteers infrequently and may ask questions that would not be necessary had the student prepared for class.<br />
  D = Student is unprepared and/or inattentive. Student rarely volunteers and demonstrates lack of involvement in class activities. Student may not stay on task in group work and may ask unnecessary or inappropriate questions. <br />
  F = Student is disrespectful and exhibits a lack of concern for the class. His or her behavior 
may have a negative effect on the class</p>
<h2>EXAMS</h2>
<p>There will be a midterm (15% of final grade) and a final exam (15% of final grade) as indicated on the <a href="318sysp13.html">Syllabus</a><a href="222syfa12.html"></a>. Make-up for exams will be granted 
  only if you are excused <strong>in advance</strong> with proper documentation. Bring paper/blue books.  (There will be an automatic 5-point penalty for students who come to class without  paper/blue book or pen/pencil.)  </p>

<p>Midterm: As part of the midterm (20 points out of 100) you will prepare and turn in your own <em><strong>Glossaire  du cin&eacute;ma</strong></em>. It should include a<span class="red"> minimum of 40 terms</span> in French and English and an illustrative example (in words or with an image) from a film you have seen<span class="red"> for 20 of those terms</span>. Here is a <a href="318Glossaire.docx">template</a> to give you an idea. Some useful resources include: Singerman (3-7), Corrigan (180-183), Wikipedia &quot;<a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossaire_du_cin%C3%A9ma">Glossaire du Cin&eacute;ma</a>.&quot; I've also found a series of YouTube videos called &quot;Frame by Frame&quot; very helpful, such as this one on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwEnJRUogYA">Camera Moves</a>. If you find other notable resources, please let me know.</p>
<p>For both exams, I will show you  clips that we have discussed in class as well a short film that we have not and ask you to write about them, using appropriate vocabulary and connections with films seen during the semester. Use the first three sets of questions on the <a href="318Questions.html">Question Page</a> as a prompt for your studying and writing.  The <a href="318FilmScoringRubric.html">Scoring Rubric</a> (for the term project) shows how your papers
  will be graded and what to strive for in the areas of content, organization 
and format, grammar, vocabulary and fluency. I will be looking for the same qualities on the exams, although my expectations are different since the exams are timed.</p>
<p><strong>SUPPLEMENTARY FILMS</strong><br />
  There is a list of American and French Supplementary Films in the right-hand column of the <a href="318sysp15.html">Syllabus</a> that I believe are valuable additions to the required films. I have listed the films in connection with the time period being studied that week. You will be required to write three short papers in French (2-3 pages, doubled-spaced) about three different films from this list, analyzing the film and connecting them with the works we are studying. Due dates are listed on the <a href="318sysp15.html">Syllabus</a>, but the papers may also be turned in at any time before the assigned dates, as well. Each paper will be worth three homework assignments. For useful French vocabulary, see the <a href="articulation.html">articulation</a> and <a href="318VocabulaireOpinion.html">expressing an opinion</a> pages.</p>
<h2>PRESENTATion AND Paper</h2>
<p>In addition to  <a href="318devoirssp13.html">Les Devoirs</a>, you will work on a French film of your choice. To select your film, see the list of recommended films in Singerman (373-77) or the list of <a href="318Must-see.html">Must-see French films</a>. You may also choose another French film that is not on either of these lists with my permission. Beginning with your choice of the film by<span class="date"> January 28</span>, you will have a weekly assignment to complete on the film in the form of a <a href="318Journal.html">journal</a> shared with me via Google Docs (10% of your final grade). In <span class="date">April,</span> there will also be a presentation of the film (15% of final grade) as well as  a Final Paper (15% of final grade). Due 
  dates for the presentation and paper are listed on the <a href="318sysp13.html">Syllabus</a>. Due dates for the journal are listed on the journal <a href="318Journal.html">page</a>. There will be penalties for any late submissions. </p>
<p><strong>Presentations:</strong> The class <a href="318Presentation15.html">presentations</a> will be on the last four days of class. Each presentation should be approximately 10 minutes long, including a clip of not more than 5 minutes to share with the class. The presentation will be graded by the entire class based on this <a href="318Peereval.html">rubric</a></p>
<p>Pr&eacute;parez <strong>une fiche p&eacute;dagogique</strong> pour la classe avec le titre du film, le r&eacute;alisateur, les personnages et acteurs principaux, notes sur le vocabulaire, la structure, le th&egrave;mes, et les sources consult&eacute;es. Mettez la <em>fiche pedagogique</em> on the Google Docs <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/document/d/1mU9sPk-0fWWhjaImnUe3BQ7nw76P1zUJVMNZjLKZhwE/edit?usp=sharing">page</a> to share with the class. Presentations will be arranged chronologically. </p>

<p><strong>MUSEUM VISIT</strong></p>
<p> To enhance our appreciation of the arts, you will visit the <a href="http://www.ncartmuseum.org/">North Carolina Museum of Art</a> during the semester and write a 2-3 page paper in French about your visit. Choose at least two works to discuss and connect them, if possible, with the films we have been studying. You may go on your own or join one of the organized visits listed on the Syllabus on <span class="date">Fridays</span> from 7-8:30: <span class="date">January 30</span>, <span class="date">February 13</span>, and <span class="date">April 17</span>. <a href="mailto:dsbeckma@ncsu.edu">Email</a> me to sign up for one of the extra-credit guided visits. This assignment is worth 3 homeworks. </p>
<p>Here is a handy <span class="section1">thinking routine</span> to use to take notes about what you see, and <a href="ParisArtsFrenchArtVocab.html">vocabulary</a> for talking about art in French. See more <a href="318NCMA.html">information</a> and vocabulary about fifteen French works featured in the NCMA collection. </p>

<p><strong>CULTURAL CONVERSATIONS</strong></p>
<p>In January 2011, the French business school <a href="http://www.skema.edu/en/usa">SKEMA</a> opened a new campus at NCSU. As part of FLF 318, you are required to attend one of twenty two-hour Cultural Conversation workshops  organized by the Global Training Institute (GTI) between <span class="date">March 2</span> <span class="date">and March 26</span>. This workshop provides NC State and SKEMA Business School students the opportunity to explore cultural differences. Students spend most of their time in small groups discussing the differences in social behaviors and expectations. The discussions are facilitated and led by a group of trained peer leaders and allow students to examine the similarities and differences among our cultures. For some background on cultural stereotypes, you can visit web sites such as <a href="http://www.understandfrance.org/France/Intercultural.html">understandingfrance.org</a>. You can get more information about this event and sign up for your preferred time slot <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/gti/iclp/culturalconversations.php">here</a>. You will submit a 1-3 page paper in French about your experience to receive credit for this assignment. This paper, worth three homeworks, is due <span class="date">Monday, March 30.</span></p>
<p>Sign up for the GTI's Cultural Connections newsletter at <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/gti/index.php">http://www.ncsu.edu/gti/index.php</a> to be informed about campus and local events. You can also sign up to become involved with the GTI's International Cultural Leadership Project	(ICLP) over the course of the semester. 
  As an incentive, students who successfully complete this program will receive <span class="extracredit">2 extra credit</span> points towards their final grade (see below). Go to <a href="http://go.ncsu.edu/ICLP">http://go.ncsu.edu/ICLP</a> for more information. If you are involved with the ICLP for two semesters, you will also be eligible to apply for a $1000 <a href="https://packabroad.ncsu.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgram&amp;Program_ID=2000#ICLP">Study Abroad Scholarship</a>. </p>
<h2>EXTRA CREDIT, SERVCE LEARNING and HONORS CREDIT</h2>
<p> You may also earn 2 points of service-learning extra credit towards your final grade by participating in the <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/gti/gti_students/gti_SKEMAvolunteer.php">GTI</a> International Cultural Leadership Project  for <a href="http://www.skema.edu/en/usa">SKEMA</a>, the new French business school on the NCSU Campus. To become a volunteer, see <a href="http://go.ncsu.edu/ICLP">http://go.ncsu.edu/ICLP</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, you can  see other French films or attend supplementary art or literary activities that relate 
  to our class. To get extra credit, write me something about what you learned or something that impressed you.</p>
<p class="style14">Students have also approached me about getting honor credit for the class. I am happy to work with you to design a project that will meet those requirements. The Honors Contract must be submitted by  the 10th day of the semester.</p>
<h2>COURSE EVALUATIONS</h2>
<p>Online class evaluations will be available for students to complete in the last few weeks of the semester. Students will receive an email message directing them to a website where they can login using their Unity ID and complete evaluations.  All evaluations are confidential; instructors will never know how any one student responded to any question, and students will never know the ratings for any particular instructors.<br />
  Student help desk: <a href="mailto:classeval@ncsu.edu">classeval@ncsu.edu</a><br />
More information about ClassEval: <a href="http://www2.acs.ncsu.edu/UPA/classeval/">http://www2.acs.ncsu.edu/UPA/classeval/</a></p>
<p>To thank a teacher for a job well done, consider writing a note via the Office of Faculty Development's <a href="http://ofd.ncsu.edu/thank-a-teacher/">Thank a Teacher</a> site. Not only will your professor receive a letter from the Provost, but his/her department and college heads will be notified, too.</p>
<h2>STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES</h2> <p>For all students currently registered with 
    the  Disability Services for Students (DSO), an accommodation letter 
    will be sent to the instructor. This letter verifies that appropriate documentation 
    is on file and that the student has a substantiated disability requiring effective 
    reasonable accommodations. Any student requesting accommodations for whom a 
    letter has not been written must see a DSO service provider. Students with disabilities, for whom a letter of accommodation has been sent 
  from the DSO office to the instructor, should schedule an appointment with the 
  instructor immediately. </p>
<p>DSO information can be found  at
<a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/dso">http://www.ncsu.edu/dso</a> or call the office directly at 919 515-7653.</p>
<p><strong>SUPPORTING FELLOW STUDENTS IN DISTRESS</strong><strong><br />

  As members of the NC State Wolfpack community, we each share a personal responsibility to express concern for one another and to ensure that this classroom and the campus as a whole remains a safe environment for learning. &nbsp;Occasionally, you may come across a fellow classmate whose personal behavior concerns or worries you. When this is the case, I would encourage you to report this behavior to the NC State Students of Concern website: <a href="http://studentsofconcern.ncsu.edu/" target="_blank">http://studentsofconcern.ncsu.edu</a>/. &nbsp;Although you can report anonymously, it is preferred that you share your contact information so they can follow-up with you personally.</p>
<h2>DIVERSITY POLICY</h2>
<p>This course fosters free and open dialogue, the acceptance and discussion of different opinions, and mutual respect among class members. Since class participation is required, it is important that students not be afraid to speak up and share their ideas. If you ever feel that you have been intimidated or treated disrespectfully in class, by me or by another student, please come see me in private as soon as possible. That is not the environment I desire for this class. </p>
<p>Every member of the university community has the right to work and learn in an environment free from discrimination and harassment. Since everyone has this right, everyone also has the responsibility to help prevent discrimination or harassment from occurring.  One of the most important ways is to respect others and make sure your actions serve as a role model for others. You can also:</p><ul>
<li>Get to know those around you.</li>
<li>Our literary texts discuss sensitive topics such as sex, race, ethnicity, and religion. Your observations on these topics should relate to the works we are studying and your responses to them.</li>
<li>Refrain from using jokes, words, and gestures with sexual, racial, religious, or other discriminatory connotations.</li>
<li>Respect others' personal space. </li>
<li>Avoid making assumptions about others. Ask for their opinions and insights.</li>
<li>As members of a university community, we all have the right to work and learn without being discriminated against or harassed. We also have some responsibilities &mdash; to help prevent discrimination and harassment, and to help address it when it does occur.</li></ul>

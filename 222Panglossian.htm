<p class="style1">Word of the Day for Friday April 8, 2005
</p>
<p class="style1"> <span class="style2">Panglossian</span> \pan-GLOSS-ee-uhn\, adjective:<br>
  Excessively or naively optimistic.</p>
<p class="style1"> He is not peddling a <span class="style2">Panglossian</span> view of the world, or<br>
  denying that there are problems that merit action.<br>
  --Jon Jewett, &quot;Enviro-skepticism,&quot; Policy Review, December<br>
  2001/January 2002</p>
<p class="style1"> But only the most <span class="style2">Panglossian</span> among us can doubt that in<br>
  this fevered political climate more silencings will come.<br>
  --Gloria Cooper, &quot;The Censors,&quot; [1]Columbia Journalism<br>
  Review, July/August 2004</p>
<p class="style1"> What we are witnessing in large part is the debris of the<br>
  collapsed illusions of the 80s, when the <span class="style2">Panglossian</span><br>
  president's natural optimism made it impossible for him to<br>
  admit that America had any problems.<br>
  --Mortimer B. Zuckerman, &quot;The politics of trivial pursuit,&quot;<br>
  [2]US News &amp; World Report, April 13, 1992</p>
<p class="style1"> Despite its excesses, the French critique of the modern<br>
  world -- of our varieties of bad faith, our idolatrous<br>
  consumerism, and our <span class="style2">Panglossian</span> faith in progress and<br>
  other Enlightenment values -- has helped make it possible<br>
  for men and women to live examined lives.<br>
  --Jay Tolson, &quot;The Passion of Michel Foucault,&quot; [3]National<br>
  Review, February 15, 1993</p>
<p class="style1"> I wonder, though, if her argument does not commit her to a<br>
  deep optimism about human nature which, despite its<br>
  emotional pull, may strike some readers as slightly<br>
  <span class="style2">Panglossian</span>.<br>
  --David McCabe, &quot;Democracy on Trial,&quot; [4]Commonweal,<br>
  February 10, 1995<br>
  _________________________________________________________</p>
<p class="style1"> <span class="style2">Panglossian</span> derives from <span class="style2">Pangloss</span>, the optimistic tutor in<br>
  Voltaire's [5]Candide.</p>
<p class="style1"> Candide, penetrated with so much goodness, threw himself at<br>
  his feet, crying, &quot;Now I am convinced that my Master<br>
  <span class="style2">Pangloss</span> told me truth when he said that everything was for<br>
  the best in this world; for I am infinitely more affected<br>
  with your extraordinary generosity than with the inhumanity<br>
  of that gentleman in the black cloak and his wife.&quot;<br>
  --Voltaire, [6]Candide</p>

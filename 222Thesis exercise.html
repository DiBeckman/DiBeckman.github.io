<p class="style2">1) How to write a thesis for a humanities paper:</p>
<p class="style1"><span class="style3">from: <a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/%7Ewricntr/documents/Thesis.html">http://www.fas.harvard.edu/%7Ewricntr/documents/Thesis.html</a><br />

    &quot;Think of yourself as a member of a jury, listening to a lawyer who is presenting an opening argument. You'll want to know very soon whether the lawyer believes the accused to be guilty or not guilty, and how the lawyer plans to convince you. Readers of academic essays are like jury members: before they have read too far, they want to know what the essay argues as well as how the writer plans to make the argument. After reading your thesis statement, the reader should think, 'This essay is going to try to convince me of something. I'm not convinced yet, but I'm interested to see how I might be.'<br />
  <br />
An effective <span class="style6">thesis</span> cannot be answered with a simple 'yes' or 'no.' A <span class="style6">thesis</span> is not a <span class="style6">topic</span>; nor is it a </span><span class="style8">fact</span><span class="style3">; nor is it an <span class="style6">opinion</span>. 'Reasons for the fall of communism' is a <span class="style6">topic</span>. 'Communism collapsed in Eastern Europe' is a <span class="style6">fact</span> known by educated people. 'The fall of communism is the best thing that ever happened in Europe' is an <span class="style6">opinion</span>. (Superlatives like 'the best' almost always lead to trouble. It's impossible to weigh every 'thing' that ever happened in Europe. And what about the fall of Hitler? Couldn't that be 'the best thing'?)</span></p>
<p class="style3">A good thesis has two parts. It should tell what you plan to argue, and it should 'telegraph' how you plan to argue&hellip;</p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Some Caveats and Some Examples</strong><br />
    <strong>A <span class="style6">thesis</span> is never a question</strong>. Readers of academic essays expect to have questions discussed, explored, or even answered. A question ('Why did communism collapse in Eastern Europe?') is not an argument, and without an argument, a thesis is dead in the water.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>A <span class="style6">thesis</span> is never a list</strong>. 'For political, economic, social and cultural reasons, communism collapsed in Eastern Europe' does a good job of 'telegraphing' the reader what to expect in the essay&mdash;a section about political reasons, a section about economic reasons, a section about social reasons, and a section about cultural reasons. However, political, economic, social and cultural reasons are pretty much the only possible reasons why communism could collapse. This sentence lacks tension and doesn't advance an argument. Everyone knows that politics, economics, and culture are important.</p>
<p><span class="style3"><strong>A <span class="style6">thesis</span> should never be vague, combative or confrontational.</strong> An ineffective thesis would be, 'Communism collapsed in Eastern Europe because communism is evil.' This is hard to argue (evil from whose perspective? what does evil mean?) and it is likely to mark you as moralistic and judgmental rather than rational and thorough. It also may spark a defensive reaction from readers sympathetic to communism. If readers strongly disagree with you right off the bat, they may stop reading.<br />
  <strong><br />
  An effective <span class="style6">thesis</span> has a definable, arguable claim.</strong> 'While cultural forces contributed to the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, the disintegration of economies played the key role in driving its decline' is an effective thesis sentence that 'telegraphs,' so that the reader expects the essay to have a section about cultural forces and another about the disintegration of economies. This thesis makes a definite, arguable claim: that the disintegration of economies played a more important role than cultural forces in defeating communism in Eastern Europe. The reader would react to this statement by thinking, 'Perhaps what the author says is true, but I am not convinced. I want to read further to see how the author argues this claim.'<br />
    <br />
    <strong>A <span class="style6">thesis</span> should be as clear and specific as possible</strong>. Avoid overused, general terms and abstractions. For example, 'Communism collapsed in Eastern Europe because of the ruling elite's inability to address the economic concerns of the people' is more powerful than 'Communism collapsed due to societal discontent.' &quot;<br />
    <span class="style6"><strong><br />
2) </strong></span></span><span class="style2">How to write a thesis for a literary paper </span></p>
<p><span class="style3">from <a href="http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/thesis-statements/">http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/thesis-statements/</a><a href="http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/thesis.html"></a><br />
  <br />
  &hellip; Let's look at another example. Suppose your literature professor hands out the following assignment in a class on the American novel: Write an analysis of some aspect of Mark Twain's novel <u>Huckleberry Finn</u>. 'This will be easy,' you think. 'I loved Huckleberry Finn!' You grab a pad of paper and write:<br />
  <em><br />
  Mark Twain's <u>Huckleberry Finn</u> is a great American novel</em>.<br />
  <br />
  Why is this thesis weak? Think about what the reader would expect from the essay that follows: you will most likely provide a general, appreciative summary of Twain's novel. The question did not ask you to summarize; it asked you to analyze. Your professor is probably not interested in your opinion of the novel; instead, she wants you to think about why it's such a great novel&mdash;what do Huck's adventures tell us about life, about America, about coming of age, about race relations, etc.? First, the question asks you to pick an aspect of the novel that you think is important to its structure or meaning&mdash;for example, the role of storytelling, the contrasting scenes between the shore and the river, or the relationships between adults and children. Now you write:<br />
  <br />
  <em>In <u>Huckleberry Finn</u>, Mark Twain develops a contrast between life on the river and life on the shore.</em><br />
  <br />
  Here's a working thesis with potential: you have highlighted an important aspect of the novel for investigation; however, it's still not clear what your analysis will reveal. Your reader is intrigued, but is still thinking, 'So what? What's the point of this contrast? What does it signify?' Perhaps you are not sure yet, either. That's fine&mdash;begin to work on comparing scenes from the book and see what you discover. Free write, make lists, jot down Huck's actions and reactions. Eventually you will be able to clarify for yourself, and then for the reader, why this contrast matters. After examining the evidence and considering your own insights, you write:<br />
  <br />
  Through its contrasting river and shore scenes, Twain's <u>Huckleberry Finn</u> suggests that to find the true expression of American democratic ideals, one must leave 'civilized' society and go back to nature.<br />
  <br />
  This final thesis statement presents an interpretation of a literary work based on an analysis of its content. Of course, for the essay itself to be successful, you must now present evidence from the novel that will convince the reader of your interpretation.</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style3"><span class="style6"><strong>3) To put these ideas into action: 
    </strong></span><br />
    <br />
  The following ideas are drawn from a <a href="http://www.simmons.edu/~/media/Simmons/About/The-Writing-Center/Documents/Lowry-Pei-Material/What_constitutes_a_thesis.ashx?la=en">handout</a> by Geoff Turner, an associate Professor of Psychology at Simmons College. <br />
  <br />
  <span class="style6">What Constitutes a Thesis</span><br />
  <br />
  Thesis Statements<br />
  A thesis statement sets the direction for a rhetorical paper &ndash; it tells the reader what point you are trying to make. The thesis statement is the argument that you attempt to prove, the statement that you support with evidence. Several theses are listed below. Your job is to rank the thesis statements according to the following scale.<br />
  0 &ndash; Not a thesis statement at all.<br />
  1 &ndash; A thesis statement, but not a good one.<br />
  2 &ndash; A good thesis statement.<br />
</span></p>
<p class="style5">Examples:<br />
  __0__ 1. I prefer chocolate ice cream to strawberry ice cream.<br />
  __0__ 2. My friend&rsquo;s dating habits are very interesting.<br />
  __1__ 3. There are nine planets in our solar system.<br />
  __1__ 4. Most teenagers are happy with their parents.<br />
  __2__  5. Hoover&rsquo;s laissez-faire economic policies doomed the U.S. economy to a nearly decade- long depression.<br />
  <br />
  The first two statements are opinions, and therefore non-provable. You can&rsquo;t argue about whether I prefer chocolate ice cream. I do. Period. The third is a thesis, but it&rsquo;s a bad one because it&rsquo;s trivial, while the fourth isn&rsquo;t so good because it&rsquo;s too general or grand to be proven by you. Note that it isn&rsquo;t that no one can prove the fourth statement; it just isn&rsquo;t likely that you will in a three page paper for this class. The last is not only a thesis, but it&rsquo;s a good one insofar as it can be supported by evidence. </p>

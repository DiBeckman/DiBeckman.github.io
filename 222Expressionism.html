In Germany, between 1910 and 1925. Precursors in painting: Van Gogh, Gauguin and 
Munch; in literature: Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Dostoevsky, and Nietzsche.<br>

Radical revolt against subject matter and style of <font color="#FF0000"><a href="222Realism.html">Realism</a></font>. 
Artist presents a troubled or intensely emotional vision of human life and human 
society by violently exaggerating and distorting objective features of the outer 
world and embodying extremes of mood and feeling. Man often stands alone and afraid 
in an industrial, technological, and urban society which is disintegrating into 
chaos. In fiction, standard modes of characterization and plot are abandoned for 
symbolic figures involved in a dream-world of nightmarish events.</font><br>

  <b>COURSE OBJECTIVES:</b> <br>
  1) To improve your ability to understand, speak, read, and write French; <br>
  2) To expose you to important aspects of French and Francophone culture; <br>
  3) to prepare you for advanced coursework in French, and for study, work, or 
  travel in French-speaking settings. <br>
  <br>
  In order to accomplish these goals, we must use French as the principal language 
  of the classroom. Although most of you will be taking this course as a requirement, 
  foreign language will enhance your career opportunities, whether in the sciences, 
  social sciences, arts, or humanities. Recruiters in business, banking, government, 
  education, the media, and industry are increasingly looking for people with 
  foreign-language abilities.<br>
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">In 
  addition to enhancing your professional opportunities, studying French can have 
  other significant benefits. First, it can provide the chance for meaningful 
  travel to France or the Francophone world (Qu&eacute;bec, a number of Caribbean 
  islands, many African countries, Belgium, Switzerland, Tahiti, etc.) Second, 
  in learning about the differences and similarities of another culture, you achieve 
  a new perspective on your own. As Benjamin Franklin--who lived in Paris for 
  several years--once said: &#147;It is only possible to truly understand one&#146;s 
  own country by understanding another.&#148; </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>PLACEMENT 
  AND PREREQUISITES</b>: Successful completion of FLF 102 at NCSU, transfer credit 
  of its equivalent at another university, or placement into FLF 201 on the NCSU 
  Placement Test. The Placement Test can be taken in the Foreign Language Technology 
  Center (212 Laundry Bldg.). The test will take 20-25 minutes and you will receive 
  the results immediately. If you are a student in CHASS and Management, minoring 
  in a language or a French or Spanish major, you must take FLF 201 for a grade 
  rather than Credit Only or Audit.<br>

  Tuesday/ Thursday with no penalty.<b> Each additional absence will reduce your

  This policy is based on the University attendance policy. Assignments must be 
  turned in on time for full credit. There are no make-up exams unless the absence 
  is due to serious illness, injury, death or illness in the family, university 
  duties, court attendance, or religious observance. Upon return to class after 
  an absence, you are responsible for any homework, quizzes, compositions, etc. 
  assigned for that day. Students should exchange phone numbers early in the session 
  so that you can call each other in the event that you are unsure of an assignment.

  the previous class session. We will have three written exams during the term, 
  covering selected material from the text (vocabulary, reading, discussions), 
  grammar, and lab exercises. You will also have an individual oral exam at the 
  end of the term. It will count as the equivalent of one written exam. The final 
  exam will be cumulative. <br>

  <br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESPONSIBLITIES:</b> 
  I will do my best to make the class atmosphere creative, lively, and accepting 
  of your best efforts. In turn, you too have some responsibilities.... <br>
  <br>
  1) <b>Prepare assignments before coming to class</b> so we can get the most 
  out of our classtime <br>
  together. Assignments are to be completed as indicated on the syllabus. It is 
  nearly impossible to &#147;cram&#148; for this course and do well. Learning 
  a language is like building a house of cards: each one must be well in place 
  before adding the next. I urge you to spend at least 30 minutes on French per 
  day, rather than studying all at once before exams. Regular repetition of small 
  quantities of information is the most successful method for learning a foreign 
  language. <br>
  <br>
  2) <b>Participate actively </b>in each lesson<b>.</b> Mentally answer each and 
  every question when a classmate is responding. Class participation and homework 
  make up 25% of your grade. The more you participate, the better your grade will 
  be, and the better your French will become. Your class grade reflects your performance 
  in class (attendance, knowledge of daily lesson, volunteering answers, asking 
  questions, class reflections). You should work constantly with the language 
  lab tapes. Play them on your car or home stereo; even if you&#146;re not always 
  actively listening, it will help your proficiency. You will often have to listen 
  to the tapes more than once, so don&#146;t get discouraged if you cannot understand 
  every word the first time. The tape exercises will get easier as the semester 
  progresses, if you make the effort. Take the tape work seriously &#151; it will 
  help both your proficiency and your grade (there is a listening component on 
  exams). <br>
  <br>
  3) <b>Take risks.</b> Speak out. Don&#146;t be afraid to make mistakes. I am 
  here to help. The more you speak, the more you will get out of the class. <br>
  <br>
  4) <b>Speak French as much as possible</b> in the classroom. To this end, the 
  following expressions will be helpful: <br>
  </font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">R&eacute;p&eacute;tez, 
  s&#146;il vous pla&icirc;t. Repeat, please <br>
  Comment dit-on &#147;....&#148; en fran&ccedil;ais? How do you say &#147;....&#148; 
  in French? <br>
  Que veut dire &#147;....&#148;? What does &#147;....&#148; mean? <br>
  Qu&#146;est-ce que c&#146;est? What&#146;s that? <br>
  Je ne sais pas. I don&#146;t know. <br>
  Je ne comprends pas. I don&#146;t understand. <br>
  J&#146;ai une question. I have a question. <br>
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">5) 
  <b>Bring textbook</b> to class every day. This is essential. You should also 
  purchase a decent quality <br>
  French/English-English/French dictionary. While not required, it will help you 
  find words not <br>
  explained in the textbook. <br>
  <br>
  6) <b>Be playful and participate</b> in games, songs, skits, and conversations. 
  <br>
  <br>
  7) <b>Take notes</b> in class whenever appropriate. Buy 3x5 notecards to make 
  personalized verb charts and other study aids. Study together in pairs or groups 
  outside of class. <br>
  <br>
  8) <b>Use French outside of class.</b> See French movies in theaters or on video 
  (Blockbuster, North American Video, and the Media Center in D.H. Hill Library 
  have great French film collections). Talk to your roomates and friends in French. 
  Listen to French CDs and visit French web sites. Go to cultural events sponsored 
  by organizations such as the Triangle&#146;s Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise (I will 
  announce these in class). You are also welcome to join the French Club during 
  the academic year, to get extra exposure to the language, and to meet French 
  and Francophone students. You can earn <b>extra credit</b> by turning in commentaries 
  on French-related films, art exhibits, or other cultural experiences. <br>
  <br>
  <b>I look forward to a pleasant and productive semester! Don't hesitate to ask 
  me for help and assistance in person or by </b><a href="mailto:dibeckman@aol.com">email</a>.

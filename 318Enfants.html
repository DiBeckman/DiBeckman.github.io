<p><strong>B. La guerre et l’occupation (1939-1945)</strong><em><br />
  <br />
    5. Les Enfants du paradis </em>de Marcel Carné (1943-5)<em><br />
    <br />
  &quot;Les Enfants du paradis </em>occupies a unique place in French cinema. It is one of the rare films to have been genuinely popular—because of its subject, its roots and its history. It is a film which has become greater with the passage of time. Prévert and Carné together created, all of a piece, a world people by a half-dozen protagonists who, with their common, deep bond, with basic French culture, rank with the tremendous characters created by Victor Hugo and Emile Zola…Like the great archetypal novels of the nineteenth century, <em>Les Enfants du paradis</em> is always alive to an audience that does not age. On 14 December 1984, an elegant cinema was opened in the Pompidou Center in Paris. It is called the 'Salle Garance' &quot; (Jeancolas, 86-7).</p>
<p><strong>Conditions:</strong> The budget for this film was the largest for any French film to date. &quot;The film would have been an impressive achievement under any circumstances, but under the Occupation, it was little short of miraculous. For example, the <em>Boulevard de Crime</em> set was the largest and most complicated set ever built for a French film, with more than 1500 extras (Forbes, 9). &quot;Taking three months to build, eight hundred cubic meters of earth was removed and replaced by thirty-five tons of scaffolding. Three hundred and five tons of plaster and five hundred square meters of glass were required to build the fifty facades of theatres and other buildings…Trauner once asserted that the film would not have been made if it had not been for the black market (McCann, 53).</p>
<p><strong><span class="class">Réalisme poétique</span></strong>: un mélange unique d'<span class="date">histoire</span> et d'<span class="blue">imagination:</span> &quot;A fresco conceived on a majestic scale, Children of Paradise sweeps its audience back to the 1820s, painting the detail of a world obsessed with both theatre and crime. The <span class="blue">original</span> screenplay by Jacques Prévert drew its <span class="blue">inspiration</span> from such colorful personalities of the period such as <span class="date">Jean-Gaspard Duburau</span>, the innovative mime (Baptiste), <span class="date">Pierre-François Lacenaire, </span>a murderer who went to the scaffold; and <span class="date">Frédérick Lemaître</span>, a celebrated actor for whom Alexandre Dumas and Victor Hugo wrote plays…The result was a tightly plotted narrative dominated by the <span class="blue">fictional</span> figure of <span class="blue">Garance </span>(played by the inimitable Arletty) a women who arouses the passion and envy of the film's four leading men (Cowrie, 4).</p>
<p>Like many French films in the years between 1935-1950, <em>Les Enfants du paradis</em> is first and foremost a superb piece of scriptwriting…The dialogue…is Prévert alone, supreme master of his language, already close to many of the actors for whom he had etched superb lines in other Carné films… [<em>Les Enfants du paradis</em>] distils, sums up, and surpasses <span class="class">French-style realism</span>. The characters imagined by the poet, Prévert, come alive, they are no longer 'acted upon' by an inhuman fate. All of them, even the minor characters and extras, have rare depth and complexity. With the exception of Jéricho, the rag-and-bone man who derives from the past and brings only misfortune, they are both manipulators and manipulated, at the same time or alternately, they have their reasons for what they do, and among these reasons there are some good ones…Life is not much fun, especially in 1943. But for one moment, one evening, one night of love, life is redeemed. (Jeancolas, 84-5, 86).</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration</strong> &amp; <strong>Occupation</strong><br />
  &quot;One of the most significant meanings of 
    <em>Les Enfants du paradis</em> is that it contributes to a nationalist project. It is a work that was designed to fulfill the ambition, nourished by filmmakers, Vichy sympathizers and French patriots alike, to beat the Americans at their own game by producing a spectacular film which was distinctively French. Its scale and ambition were marks of the vitality of French culture, politically important statements that French individuality would survive assaults, both from elsewhere in Europe and from across the Atlantic&quot; (Forbes, 18).<br />
  <br />
&quot;When Carné heard the news of the Allied landings in the Normandy in spring 1944, he deliberately slowed down the post-production process. He instinctively realized that rather than being the last film of the Occupation, <em>Les Enfants du Paradis</em> could be the first film of the Liberation&quot;. (McCann, 53)</p>
<p>Although the film works perfectly well at a surface level, every character, every gesture springs from a coded approach to contemporary history. Garance, with her stalwart commitment to liberty and the simple things in life, represents Occupied France. The count serves as a chilling paradigm for the Nazi regime, believing that his opulence can purchase anything in sight. Jéricho, is the archetypal informer, flourishing in the atmosphere of confusion and mistrust in the Boulevard of Crime. (Cowrie, 4-5)</p>
<p>The opening titles specifically mention Trauner and Kosma, essential members of Carné's long time team who had to operate, as Jews &quot;dans la clandestinité.&quot; Other problems related to the war include Pierre Renoir's last-minute substitution as Jéricho, since the actor originally filmed in the role had been chased out of France as a collaborator. This will be Arletty's last great film role. She will never act again in a starring role, because she was known to have been  the mistress of a German air force colonel during the war, an activity known as &quot;horizontal collaboration.&quot; The industry and public never forgave her. </p>
<p>&quot;In a counter-cultural move the film suggests, through Baptiste, that popular art is sublime, through Garance that prostitution is patriotic, and through Lacenaire, that history is farce&quot; (Forbes, 71).</p>
<p><strong>Sexual Ambiguity:</strong> Just as the historical and political overtones of the film enable Carné and Prévert to pass oblique judgment under the Nazi yoke, so the erotic mood of the film is unusally ambiguous. Carné's own homosexuality, at a time when diversity was not exactly welcomed in the movie industry, finds its metaphor in Baptiste and his androgynous appeal. (Cowrie, 4-5) Some suggest that Baptiste's terror when Garance first offers herself to him is not just timidity, but confusion about his own sexual orientation. We might also consider the questionable relationship between Lacenaire and his rose-wearing, hot chocolate drinking side-kick, Avril, or the setting of the Turkish Bath for Lacenaire's murder of the Count.</p>
<p><strong>La Forme et le fond:</strong> Dans le scénario et sur l'écran: notez les effets de répétition,  de reflet, et de multiplication.</p>
<p><strong>Théâtre et Cinéma</strong>: &quot;[<em>Les Enfants du paradis</em>] is a film about spectacle. It is the cinema in all its glory paying homage to the theatre…to a theatre which is like its mirror.&quot; (Jeancolas, 86) &quot;The theatre is at the heart of <em>Les Enfants du paradis</em>, its structuring principle and its central metaphor. The film itself is a theatrical production which provides the framework or meta-structure within which a succession of theatrical performances in different genres—mime, pantomime, melodrama, and tragedy—are offered to our gaze and are superimposed and interwomen to form a narrative&quot; (Forbes 41).</p>
<p>[W]hen Natalie utters Baptiste's name on stage during the performance of <em>L'Amoureux de la lune</em>, she not only transgresses the separation between on and off stage and between pantomime and theatre, she also brings into focus a debate about the future of the cinema which had raged throughout the 1930s…Though <em>Les Enfants du paradis</em> is not a conventional narrative film, it nevertheless makes magnificent use of the facility of sound. But it equally celebrates all the lessons of the silent cinema in placing a mime performer at its centre and making him the key sensibility in the film, underlying the cinema's reliance on appearance, gesture, and the expressivity of the body&quot; (Forbes, 36).</p>

<p>Stories based on Pirandello's 6 Characters in Search of an Author </p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Act Four</em></strong></p>
<p><em>The audience applauds to an empty stage, assuming that what they had seen was planned to begin and end as such.&nbsp; Accordingly, they all file out of the auditorium with a sense of appreciation for the contrast of reality and fiction they have just witnessed.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the curtain sill down, and the </em>PRODUCER, ACTORS, FATHER, MOTHER, <em>and </em>SON <em>still behind it, the </em>STEPDAUGHTER <em>suddenly reappears among them.&nbsp; The </em>PRODUCER <em>and the </em>ACTORS <em>are still frozen in disbelief, but no more confused than the </em>STEPDAUGHTER <em>herself.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The </em>STEPDAUGHTER, <em>after running out into the foyer and beyond, magically ends back up on stage with her parents, brother, and others, as if the stage stood outside the auditorium doors.&nbsp; The auditorium is now empty, but the curtain yet again rises with all the characters present except for the </em>LITTLE BOY <em>and the </em>LITTLE GIRL.&nbsp; </p>
<p>PRODUCER&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[<em>Looking around at everybody in disbelief.</em>]<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Look!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s empty!&nbsp; They&rsquo;re all  gone!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve done it, we&rsquo;ve done it!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see, everyone that came to see our rehearsal thought that what happened here today was in fact the rehearsal itself.&nbsp; Brilliant!</p>
<p>STEPDAUGHTER&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[<em>Still confused as ever.</em>]&nbsp;&nbsp; What am I doing here?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s finished!&nbsp; I am free!  I am free right?&nbsp; Mother, why can I not leave this hideous place already?&nbsp; All this time I  thought that once we finished our story, we would all be free.&nbsp; And now it&rsquo;s finished, so I should be free from that horrible creature! [<em>She points to the </em>FATHER.]</p>
<p>FATHER&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No.&nbsp; We are never free from the story to which we belong.&nbsp; We were created in one  story only, and we will not ever have lives outside of that story.&nbsp; So you can run as fast as  you can, but I&rsquo;m afraid that you will never be able to escape us, the characters created in that  same story as your own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<em>The </em>STEPDAUGHTER <em>begins to sob as she listens to her father&rsquo;s explanation of her &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reappearance.&nbsp; The </em>MOTHER <em>and </em>SON <em>also seem terrified as though this conclusion &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was conflicting with their own ideas of what their futures held</em>.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, too, was unsure of what was to happen after the story was completed, but now, I see it all  clearly.&nbsp; We will remain together forever, never growing older, doing anything different,  or experiencing another emotion, nothing other than how our original author wanted us to  exist.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<em>The </em>PRODUCER,<em> after intently listening to the </em>FATHER&rsquo;S <em>theory of these characters&rsquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lives from this point onward, sneakily runs off stage to his office.&nbsp; The </em>ACTORS <em>remain &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in a state of confusion as to whether any of the day&rsquo;s events were a display of reality or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just a mere act of fiction; they continue to intently listen while trying to put together the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; array of the day&rsquo;s puzzle pieces.</em>]</p>
<p>SON&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But Father, I cannot live with this woman any longer. [<em>Pointing to his Mother.</em>]&nbsp; It is  obvious that she cannot live with us for long either.&nbsp; You must do something, Father, you must do something now!</p>
<p>MOTHER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<em>Still sobbing, and with a baffled sound in her voice</em>.]&nbsp; All I wanted is the best for everyone.&nbsp; Where are the rest of my children?&nbsp; [<em>To the </em>STEPDAUGHTER]&nbsp; Bring them back. You came back, so where are they?&nbsp; Did you see them out in the foyer?&nbsp; Where are my  youngest children!?</p>
<p>SON&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course my existence wouldn&rsquo;t be good enough for the likes of someone such as you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never been enough, and I&rsquo;m certainly not now.</p>
<p>STEPDAUGHTER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<em>Angrily to the </em>SON.]&nbsp; Do you have to act like a baby at a time like this? Mother, don&rsquo;t you get it yet?&nbsp; That despicable imposter of a father is actually right.&nbsp; We are  all just characters.&nbsp; And, of course I didn&rsquo;t see my siblings in the foyer, they are dead, &nbsp;Mother.&nbsp; That was their role in the story, to die.&nbsp; And now that they have done so and we  have finally acted the scene out all the way through, they are gone, gone for good.</p>
<p>FATHER&nbsp;&nbsp; [<em>As if with a new idea in his voice</em>.]&nbsp; Wait a minute!&nbsp; If they are gone for good and not  coming back, then that means that we are still at the end of our story.&nbsp; But when does our  story begin again?&nbsp; When will the children reappear?&nbsp; Why have they not done so yet?&nbsp; What  if&hellip;</p>
<p>STEPDAUGHTER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<em>Rudely interrupting.</em>]&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be so silly old man.&nbsp; I am not acting out that scene with you again!&nbsp; There will not be another beginning to our story.&nbsp; We did what we have come to do, and now we are finished!</p>
<p>FATHER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, you are wrong!&nbsp; We have not done what we have come to do.&nbsp; All we have  done since we have been here is act out what has already been written for us.&nbsp; The story in which we have presented is just the unfinished story in which we have lived in since our  creation.&nbsp; But we did not come just to act out what has already been written for us!&nbsp; We came in search of an author to finish our story!</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[<em>Just at this time, the </em>PRODUCER <em>runs in waiving some paper around as if it were   aflame.&nbsp; The </em>ACTORS<em>, startled at the surprise entrance, thus far have been quiet in  listening to the characters ponder their existence.&nbsp; They have now completely turned into&nbsp; the audience to the characters&rsquo; play.</em>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PRODUCER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got it!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s finished!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve finished your story!&nbsp; [<em>Running to all four of the characters, he hands out his papers.</em>]&nbsp; Here, read over it quickly, so we can start rehearsing  the end.&nbsp; Come on now, quickly!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t just stand there like a bunch of masked statues, read  it!</p>
<p>FATHER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<em>To the </em>PRODUCER.]&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve already finished our story?</p>
<p>STEPDAUGHTER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<em>With an angry tone towards the </em>PRODUCER.]&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t even ask us  how we wanted our own story to end!?</p>
<p>MOTHER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<em>To the </em>PRODUCER <em>in a solemn tone</em>.]&nbsp; Is it a sad ending?</p>
<p>PRODUCER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<em>At this point, frustrated by the lack of confidence they&rsquo;ve all expressed in his  abilities.</em>]&nbsp; Will you all just sit down and read it!</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>The characters read the script the </em>PRODUCER <em>has created for them and talk quietly &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; among themselves.&nbsp; After doing so, somehow they all seem to agree on the ending the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </em>PRODUCER <em>has given to them.&nbsp; They start acting out the ending with the </em>PRODUCER<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  yelling out &ldquo;cut&rdquo; and &ldquo;perfect,&rdquo; fore he believes that the story of the six characters, now &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more of his own, will present itself on opening night in the place of his originally planned &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; play.</em></p>
  <p><em>&nbsp;The </em>ACTORS<em> indifferently watch the ending to this story, caring less that they have &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; become an audience to other characters.&nbsp; Throughout the confusingly, long day, they have been drawn into the story of the six characters, but more so, into its present fixation &nbsp; on the realistic effects that this fictional story includes.</em></p>
  <p><em>&nbsp;The </em>FATHER <em>makes peace with his stepdaughter.&nbsp; He regains the love of his&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;former wife, and the control of the family.&nbsp; The </em>MOTHER <em>gains the love of her son and &nbsp;&nbsp; forms a strong, loving connection with her former husband.&nbsp; The </em>STEPDAUGHTER<em>  completely forgives her father and rids her soul of all anger, leaving only room for love. The </em>SON <em>forgives his mother and embraces a long, lost family.</em></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>As the characters say their last lines in the script, each slowly begins to visually fade, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blending in with the background.&nbsp; Soon, they all are becoming invisible, and with the last &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; word of the script read aloud, they are gone.&nbsp; At that instant, all four scripts sway &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; downward to the floor, ever so smoothly and softly.&nbsp; Amazement consumes the actors, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and an overwhelming freedom overtakes the story of the six characters in search of an &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; author.</em>]</p>

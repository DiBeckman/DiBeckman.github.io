<p class="style17"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Section 1:<br>
  formalist: <br>
  <span class="style4">How does Emma's character reflect a theme of the work overall? Compare her appearance, attitude, and general nature to a theme and also to the structure of the story.</span><br>
  marxist: <br>
  <span class="style4">&bull; Does Flaubert support socialist ideals?<br>
  &bull; What does Charles' inability to climb the social ladder say about Flaubert's view of his society?<br>
  &bull; The marxist perspective tries to pinpoint differences in the social classes, but are the people in <em>Madame Bovary</em> really living very different lives? </span><br>
  <br>
  feminist: <br>
  <span class="style4">&bull; How do societal demands and the social roles of the time affect Emma and how would her personal life be different if she lived in today's world?<br>
  &bull; Does Flaubert intend to present women as continually unsatisfied through Emma's discontent and dynamic personality?<br>
  Does Emma succeed in her role as mother, head of household, etc? Is she the essence of feminism or just a fake? Does she really want to be free? Or only free when she wants to be (free to &quot;love&quot; him, but with the stability of a husband and home.)<br>
  </span></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  cultural/historical:<br>
  <span class="style4">&bull; Which aspects of the novel identify it with the realist period?<br>
  &bull; How are women portrayed and is this portrayal accurate for the period in which it was created?<br>
  &bull; How do the Enlightenment philosophers come into play?<br>
  &bull; Does the position of men and their education fit into the period?<br> 
  </span><br>
  psychological:<br>
  <span class="style4">&bull; Does Emma develop an alter ego?<br>
  &bull; How does Flaubert portray Emma's psychological state and personality through her dreams of a more rich, free, and passionate life?<br>
  &bull; How long can Madame Bovary last leading a double life? Her mental health cannot be stable when she is spending half her time pretending to be something that she really isn't, a loving wife and mother. Do you think she will eventually lose her mind and if so, what is going to be the final straw?</span><br>
  <br>
  reader response:<br>
  <span class="style4">&bull; How do Emma's unending affairs and her infatuations make the reader feel about Charles and his life? <br>
  &bull; Are there any admirable characters in this novel and if not, why did Flaubert write a novel in which there are no good people?<br>
  &bull; Based on the reader's experience, how familiar are all of the Madame Bovarys', but especially Emma's, roller-coaster emotions and discontent?<br>
  &bull; Is there a central protagonist in the story? Why is the main focus switched from character to character?</span></font></p>
<p class="style16"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Section 2:<br>
marxist:<br>
<span class="style4">&bull; How does Flaubert present the difference in class regarding faith?<br>
&bull; Would Emma still be restless if she had been born into the upper class?<br>
&bull; Would the desire to be like those who have money, like Emma's, go away in a marxist society or would it induce competition between people who are supposedly equal?<br>
&bull; How are women's lives portrayed in the story?<br>
How are the different social classes portrayed? Does it reflect the social reality of the time?<br>
&bull; Social differences such as education, pursuit of money, and the ability to portray oneself as &quot;bourgeois&quot; are key to Flaubert's commentary in the novel. What solutions does he propose throughout the novel? </span></font></p>
<p class="style16"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">feminist:<br>
    <span class="style4">&bull; Does Emma's reaction to her baby's gender reflect her own personal ideas or society's view of women?<br>
  How are male and female relationships a source of conflict in the story?<br>
  &bull; Emma's romantic nature leads her to fall in love with other men. She knows she is wrong, but is so bored with Charles. Does she feel justified in her affairs? How do they impact her relationship with Charles? Is her happiness worth violating her morals?<br>
  &bull; It seems like  Emma's &quot;power&quot; to commit adultery is the only one she has. Is this Flaubert's attempt to convey women's utter social powerlessness in his time? <br>
  &bull; Is Emma's discontent representative of women in general? Or is she just one bad woman?</span></font></p>
<p class="style16"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">cultural/historical:<br>
  <span class="style4">&bull; How does Charles' and Homais' profession help illustrate medical care during the time period?<br>
  &bull; Do Emma's feelings of wanting and needing more than medicrity reflect the time period this work represents?<br>
  &bull; Does Emma's adulterous behavior reflect the time period?</span></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  <br>
  psychological:<br>
  <span class="style4">&bull; Why is Emma the way she is? What do her past and present behavior patterns suggest for her psychological state of being?<br>
  &bull; How much of Flaubert's own personality is reflected in his characters?<br>
  </span></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  reader response: <br>
  <span class="style4">&bull; 
      What emotions or response did you feel at the end of the novel?<br>
  &bull; Was the ending satisfying to the reader?<br>
  &bull; Which character can you relate to most?<br>
  &bull; Was Emma the victim or the one who created tragedy?</span></font></p>

<p class="style2"> The narrator, while riding in a train, imagines possible characters and plots for a novel, based on her observations of another passenger whom she calls &quot;Minnie Marsh.&quot; The narrative alternates between imaginative creation and objective observation, leading the narrator to unexpected discoveries about herself and the nature of art and artistic representation.</p>
<p class="style2"><span class="style15">Main Issues</span><br>
Dislocation of chronological time, ambiguity of plot, emphasis on the perceptions and movements of authorial mind: &quot;Let us record the atoms as they fall upon the mind in the order in which they fall, let us trace the pattern, however disconnected and incoherent in appearance, which each sight or incident scores upon the consciousness&quot; (V. Woolf).</p>
<p class="style2">Concern with the process of composition and the writer's relationship to her work-in-progress; artist's response to the external world through the creation of a fictional world.</p>
<p class="style2">Emphasis on the art of writing more than portrayal of external reality; importance of creative imagination and inner, subjective reality.</p>
<p class="style2">Concern with the problem of repression: political, gender, sexual, emotional, spiritual, intellectual.</p>
<p class="style2"> Concern with issues of desire and self-understanding or misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="style2"><span class="style15">Other modernist characteristics from my poster:</span><br>Focus on language itself, writing about writing. </p>

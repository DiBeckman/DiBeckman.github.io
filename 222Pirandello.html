Characters in Search of an Author</i>; a few quotes<br>
<br>
Main theme: Illusion and reality<br>
<br>
&#147;Who are we behind the naked mask that each of us wears in society?&#148;<br>
<br>
&#147;Real human beings, unlike imagined human beings, are merely a series of 
moods, impressions, beliefs and idiosyncrasies, and social masks that can never 
be fully integrated. The human tragedy &#151;and comedy&#151; is that we keep 
trying to unify these disparate elements and are disconsolate at our failure.&#148;<br>
<br>
Father: &#147;We always have the illusion of being the same person for everybody, 
but it&#146;s not true!&#148;<br>
<br>
The CHARACTERS should not appear as ghosts&#133;<br>
FATHER: Remorse<br>
MOTHER: Sorrow<br>
STEPDAUGHTER: Revenge<br>
SON: Scorn </font>

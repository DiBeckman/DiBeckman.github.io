  <b>COURSE DESCRIPTION</b><br>
  In this course we will explore the Western literary tradition through reading, 
  discussing, and writing about some of the major works of European literature 
  from the eighteenth through twentieth centuries. We will also pay attention 
  to the political and cultural contexts of these works.<br>
  <br>
  <b>LEARNING GOALS</b><br>

  &#149; explain the characteristics of the major literary periods of Western 
  Culture from the Enlightenment to Modernism <br>
  &#149; describe how a literary text reflects its historical context <br>
  &#149; identify the literary and rhetorical devices employed in a text, such 
  as genre, point of view, irony, etc., and relate them to the content of the 
  text <br>
  &#149; discuss, orally and in writing, selected literary texts of Western Culture 
  from the 18th century to the first half of the 20th century and their continuing 
  aesthetic validity or challenge <br>

  supporting arguments with evidence (quotes) from the literary texts.<br>
  <br>
  <b>GRADING<br>
  </b></font><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Your 
  grade in this course will be computed as follows: <br>
  Attendance, Participation, Class Work, Quizzes 20%<br>
  Reading Notebook 10%<br>
  Paper 1: 10%<br>
  Paper 2: 20%<br>
  Midterm: 20%<br>
  Final Exam 20%<br>
  <br>
  There will be plus/minus grading in this class. The scale will be as follows:<br>
  A+ = 97.0-100, A = 93.0-96.9, A- = 90.0-92.9, <br>
  B+ = 87.0-89.9, B = 83.0-86.9, B- = 80.0-82.9, <br>
  C+ = 77.0-79.9, C = 73.0-76.9, C- = 70.0-72.9, <br>
  D+ = 67.0-69.9, D = 63.0-66.9, D- = 60.0-62.9, <br>
  F = 59.9 and below.<br>
  <br>
  <b>ATTENDANCE REGULATIONS</b>: Attendance is <b>required</b> and will be taken 
  daily. You are expected to arrive on time to class; repeated tardiness will 
  affect your grade. You are permitted two absences in a class taught Tuesday/ 
  Thursday with no penalty. Each additional absence will reduce your class participation 
  grade by one grade (from A to A-, from B+ to B, etc.). See me as soon as possible 
  after an absence and provide a written excuse to be accepted at my discretion 
  (in case of illness, injury, death or illness in the family, university duties, 
  court attendance, or religious observance). This policy is based upon the University 
  Attendance Policy. Save your absences for emergencies. Excessive absences may 
  lead to an F for the course.<br>
  <br>
  If you need to miss a class for one of the reasons listed above, let me know 
  in person or by email before the class meeting, if possible. Upon your return 
  to class, you are responsible for all work missed and for any assignments, including 
  quizzes, announced during your absence. I suggest that you get the name, email/IM 
  or phone number of a classmate to contact in the event that you are unsure of 
  an assignment.<br>
  <br>
  <b>CLASS PARTICIPATION</b><br>
  This grade will be determined using the following criteria: <br>
  A = you are well prepared and participate actively; you are attentive, respond 
  when called upon and volunteer often with pertinent questions and comments. 
  <br>
  B = you are usually prepared and always respond when called on; you volunteer 
  on occasion. <br>
  C= you show evidence of being unprepared; you have some trouble when called 
  on and do not volunteer often. <br>
  D = you are unprepared and/or inattentive; you never volunteer; you come to 
  class late and/or leave early. <br>
  F= you exhibit a lack of concern for the class; you sleep in class; your behavior 
  may have a negative effect on the class<br>
  <br>
  <b>READING NOTEBOOK</b><br>
  Each student is required to keep a Reading Notebook which will be turned in 
  as indicated on the syllabus. A small to medium (1&quot;) ring binder with tab 
  dividers is suggested, but other notebooks may be used. You will be graded on 
  completeness, thoughtfulness, and creativity: see <a href="222Gradingreadingnotebook.html">Notebook 
  Grading Rubric</a>.<br>
  <br>
  Section 1: <b>Just the facts</b>. One page for each work we study. Include title, 
  date, author, original language, main characters and setting, and a one paragraph 
  plot summary. These pages will be helpful when you study for exams.<br>
  <br>
  Section 2: <b>Vocabulary</b>. List of new or unfamiliar words you encounter 
  while reading or hear in class, including literary terms, along with their definitions. 
  (See also Shannon&#146;s Glossary of Literary Terms, pp. 202-208.) You should 
  have entries for each day&#146;s class.<br>
  <br>
  Section 3: <b>Lightning</b>: what struck you while you were reading. <br>
  For example: copy down memorable or provocative passages or images; include 
  your personal response to something you&#146;ve read--what it made you think 
  of in your own life. Also include at least one answer to each of Shannon&#146;s 
  4 questions (p. 27) for every class session:<br>
  What is confusing?<br>
  What is repeated?<br>
  What is familiar?<br>
  What is strange?<br>
  <br>
  These notes will be helpful when you participate in class discussion and are 
  planning your papers. <br>
  <br>
  Section 4: Class reflections, notes, written work and tests returned, etc.<br>
  <br>
  For <b>extra credit</b>, you may pair up with another student in the class and 
  make your reading notebook a &#147;dialogue&#148; reading notebook. Just before 
  or after class, or on your own time, exchange your reading notebooks and write 
  comments on your partner&#146;s entries. <br>
  <br>
  <b>EXAMS AND QUIZZES</b>: Students prepare assigned reading (see <a href="222syf03.html">Syllabus</a>) 
  <b>before</b> coming to class. There may be 5-minute quizzes the first day of 
  a new work announced the previous class period. There will be no make-up quizzes 
  for credit. <br>
  <br>
  There will be a midterm and a final exam. Make-up for exams will be granted 
  only if you are excused <b>in advance</b> with proper documentation. <br>
  <br>
  Exams will consist of:<br>
  1) Identification of selected passages: identify the author, work, approximate 
  date, and original language. Briefly discuss the character&#146;s function and 
  relevance of the passage to the work as a whole. <br>
  2) Short answer questions on literary terms and other background material<br>
  3) Essay (250 words) on a given topic or theme and how it is treated in at least 
  two works we have studied. <br>
  <br>
  <b>PAPERS</b><br>
  In addition to in-class writing assignments, you will submit two papers in draft 
  and final form: the first should be 2-3 pages and the second 4-5 pages. Due 
  dates are listed on the Syllabus. Papers should be typed in 12 pt. font, double-spaced, 
  with 1&#148; margins on all sides and with page numbers. Follow Shannon 140-141 
  for headings. Include the honor pledge &#147;I have neither given nor received 
  unauthorized assistance on this assignment&#148; with your signature on each 
  submission. <br>
  <br>
  We will work with Edward A. Shannon&#146;s book to support your writing about 
  literature. You do not need to consult critical literature on the author or 
  the text, but should engage yourself closely with the text, or an aspect of 
  it, and formulate your thoughts about it in a organized way. I am most interested 
  in your own original ideas, not someone else&#146;s, nor in a paraphrase of 
  my comments from class, our class-discussions, or the readings themselves. <br>
  <br>
  Pay attention to good organization and logical transitions between paragraphs. 
  Base your arguments on close readings. Give concrete examples (quotes) from 
  the texts to support your arguments, but not to fill up space. When referring 
  to the Norton Anthology, simply follow the following format (Flaubert, <i>Madame 
  Bovary</i>, p. 928; for poems: Blake, &#147;The Lamb,&#148; p. 543). <br>
  <br>
  If you use ideas or quotes from critical literature (books, articles, internet, 
  etc.), you need to document your sources and give proper credit to someone else&#146;s 
  ideas (whether you quote directly or rephrase their ideas)&#151;otherwise you 
  violate academic honesty and commit plagiarism (see below for policy). Do not 
  make someone else&#146;s ideas the major focus of your paper. For the format 
  of footnotes and bibliography, if you have them, refer to the MLA Style Manual 
  (available in bookstore or library) or Chapter 6 in Shannon. Shannon&#146;s 
  book addresses many issues about the process and mechanics of writing a high 
  quality paper for a university literature course; refer to it often! <br>
  <br>
  Papers are due at the beginning of the class period. Email submissions and late 
  submissions will only be accepted with my permission. <br>
  <br>
  See <a href="222poetrypresentation.html">Poetry Presentation</a>, <a href="222Paper1.html">Paper 
  1</a> and <a href="222Paper2.html">Paper 2</a> for details on each assignment. 
  <br>
  <br>
  See <a href="222scoringrubric.html">The Scoring Rubric</a> to see how your paper 
  will be graded and what to strive for in the areas of content, organization 
  and format, grammar, vocabulary and fluency, and supporting documents. <br>
  <br>
  Supporting documents: We will use a peer review process to help you improve 
  your writing. See the <a href="PeerReviewFeedback.html">Peer Review Feedback</a> 
  form. You will also fill out a <a href="Selfevalref.html">Self-Evaluation</a> 
  form to include with the Peer Review Feedback forms when you turn in your final 
  draft. <br>

  Help with your writing assignments and papers is also available at Writing and 
  Speaking Tutorial Services, check out their website at: <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/tutorial_center/writespeak/index.htm">http://www.ncsu.edu/tutorial_center/writespeak/index.htm</a><br>

  <b>HONOR CODE</b>: The Foreign Language Department takes the University Policy 
  on Academic Integrity very seriously. An atmosphere of trust, honesty and respect 
  for each other fosters educational progress and success. Please do not give 
  me any reason to be suspicious of your honesty. You are to do your own work 
  on all class assignments, papers, and exams, unless it is a designated pair 
  or group assignment. For papers that also means not incorporating others&#146; 
  ideas and presenting them as your own&#151;this is called plagiarism. Whether 
  you take ideas (verbatim or just as an idea) from books, the internet, or other 
  sources does not matter; you need to acknowledge their source if they are not 
  your own. Let me warn you especially about the temptations of the internet. 
  You will find more details in Shannon, pp. 148-150. <br>

  <b>STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES</b>: For all students currently registered with 
  the Office of Disability Services for Students (DSS), an accommodation letter 
  will be sent to the instructor. This letter verifies that appropriate documentation 
  is on file and that the student has a substantiated disability requiring effective 
  reasonable accommodations. Any student requesting accommodations for whom a 
  letter has not been written must see a DSS service provider in Suite 1900, Student 
  Health Center.<br>
  <br>
  Students with disabilities, for whom a letter of accommodation has been sent 
  from the DSS office to the instructor, should schedule an appointment with the 
  instructor immediately. <br>

  SUMMER PROGRAM IN LILLE, FRANCE</b>: Would you like to spend 5 weeks (first 
  summer session) traveling and studying in France this summer? I will be directing 
  NCSU&#146;s summer program this year. Ask me for more information on this program.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I look forward 
  to a pleasant and productive semester! Don't hesitate to ask me for help or 
  moral support in person or by <a href="mailto:dsbeckma@social.chass.ncsu.edu">email</a>. 
  My personal teaching philosophy is reflected in this quotation from educator 
  Haim Ginnott (1922-1973):</font></p>
<p> <font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#147;It's my 
  personal approach that creates the climate. It's my daily mood that makes the 
  weather. As a teacher, I possess a tremendous power to make a student's life 
  miserable or joyous. I can be a tool of torture or an instrument of inspiration. 
  I can humiliate or humor, hurt, or heal. In all situations, it is my response 
  that decides whether a crisis will be escalated or deescalated and a student 
  humanized or dehumanized.&#148; </font><br>

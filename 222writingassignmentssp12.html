  <h2 class="class">Class 2 (Pope, Lecture 1) <span class="date">due Wednesday, January 11</span></h2>
  <p> Read the argument (summary) and first stanza of Pope's <span class="text">Essay on Man</span>. Write a page about the first stanza (lines 1-16) answering Shannon's 4 questions*.</p>
  <ol class="unspaced">
    <li>What is confusing?</li>
    <li>What is repeated?</li>
    <li>What is familiar?</li>
    <li>What is strange?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>*This and all subsequent references to Shannon are from Edward Shannon's <span class="text">The Prentice Hall Guide to Writing about Literature</span> (Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2002) which went out of print in 2010. I  replaced it with <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> as a textbook for our class.</p>
  <p> Print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222Enlightenment.html">The Enlightenment</a> and <a href="222GreatChain.html">The Great Chain of Being</a></p>
  <p>Write a one-paragraph to one-page summary of Chapter 1 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>. Include the main points and any others that seem especially helpful or surprising to you. Some students prefer to an outline format. Outlining and summarizing are both useful skills. You may write or type it, and you may include it on the same page with your discussion of the first stanza of <span class="text">Essay on Man.</span></p>
  <p>In addition, for this and the next assignment, take a look at  my web page on <a href="Explication.html"><em>Explication de Texte</em></a> and these web sites about figures of speech which are also listed on the handy <a href="222supmatf04.html">Supplementary Materials</a> page. These pages will  be useful for your <a href="222poetrypresentation.html">Poetry Presentation</a> due on <span class="date">February 1 </span>and<span class="date"> 3</span>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Here is <a href="http://grammar.about.com/od/terms/a/revquiz20terms.htm?p=1">a quiz</a> you can take to assess your knowledge of the &quot;Top 20 figures of speech&quot; by Richard Norquist.</li>
    <li> <a href="http://www.nipissingu.ca/faculty/williams/figofspe.htm">This site</a> contains figures of speech, thought, repetition, more than you can shake a stick at! Most examples are drawn from Shakespeare. </li>
    <li> <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/rhetoricaldevicesinsound.htm">This site</a> is very cool because it has sound clips and draws from a wide range of speeches, movies, and more to illustrate the Figures of Speech. For example, see and listen to quotes from Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln, and Neil Armstrong on <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/figures/antithesis.htm">the page about antitheses</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="class">Class 3 (Pope, Lecture 2) <span class="date">due Friday, January 13</span></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Read <span class="text">Essay on Man</span> and write a page about your stanza to turn in. In case you're not sure what a <em>stanza</em> is, you can look this and other literary terms up in our course <a href="222Glossary.html">Glossary</a>, the Glossary in Appendix B of <span class="text">A Short Guide to Writing About Literature</span>, or a web site such as <a href="http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms.html">http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms.html</a>. <br />
      <br />
Note that the Roman numerals I-X at the beginning of each stanza correspond to your assigned stanza number (not a page or line number). What is the stanza about? Give a one sentence summary. Answer the Shannon's 4 questions. Also, what are the key words and images in the stanza? How does the stanza connect with the ideas of the Enlightenment we've discussed? What is  the attitude of the narrator? What is the role of nature, especially animals, if any appear in your stanza?</li>
    <li>Write a one-paragraph to one-page summary or outline of Chapter 2 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> to turn in. Take, correct, and turn in your answers to the Quiz in Appendix B p. 364ff of <span class="text">A Short Guide.</span></li>

      <h2 class="class">Class 4 (Voltaire, Lecture 1) <span class="date"> due Wednesday, January 18</span></h2>
      <ol class="spaced">
        <li> Read/print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222ShortStoryNovel.html">Different Forms of Prose Fiction</a>; <a href="222SatireIronyUtopia.html">Satire, Irony and Utopia</a>. Read <a href="222Panglossian.htm">Panglossian</a>. </li>

        <li>Extra credit opportunity.

How did it entertain and instruct? What figures of speech or rhetoric were used? Any literary allusions? What was repeated and familiar? (Ideally, not too much will be strange or confusing.)</li>
        <li>Consider bookmarking an online dictionary, such as <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/">dictionary.com</a> or <a href="http://www.m-w.com/">Merriam-Webster</a> to make it easy to look up words you don't know. If you are doing the Reading Notebook, you can print out the definitions to include in your notebook. Do you like words or want to improve your vocabulary (GRE in your future?)? I recommend that you sign up for the free daily email from  Anu Gang <a href="http://wordsmith.org/awad/subscribe.html">A Word a Day</a>.</li>
      </ol>
<h2 class="class">Class 5 (Voltaire, Lecture 2) <span class="date">due Friday, January 20</span>        </h2>
<li> Discuss the following questions after you do the reading assignment (Chapters 14-22). Quote from the text with examples to support your answers and include the page reference for each quotation.
<ul>
            <li>Is Eldorado a genuine utopia or (in one critic's words) &quot;a colossal bore&hellip;satirized by Voltaire as foolish and futile&quot;?</li>
            <li>Which specific behaviors or institutions show us that Voltaire wants the reader to see Eldorado as utopic?</li>
            <li>Does Voltaire have a philosophical lesson in mind or is it pure satire? Or both?</li>
            <li>How does it correspond to your personal view of Utopia?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>See Lecture Notes on <a href="222dulce.html">Dulce et utile</a>.<br />
          <br />
</li>
        <li>Read Chapter 3 in <em>A Short Guide</em> and write a summary or outline to turn in.<br />
          <br />
</li>
        <li>The first original contribution post&mdash;on Pope&mdash;is due <span class="date">tonight</span> at midnight. You will have many authors to choose from to do your required 13 posts (7 original contributions and 6 responses), but I encourage you to get in the habit of posting by starting with Pope or Voltaire. For an original contribution post, make a point or develop an argument of at least one  full paragraph (5-8 sentences) based on something you read, learned or thought while reading <em>An Essay on Man</em>. Ask a question or make a provocative statement for your classmates to respond to. You may also include a quote from the text under discussion or links to other web sites. Did something in your homework get praise or a lot of comment from me? If so, it might be the basis of a good post. 
          <h2><span class="class">Class 6 (Voltaire, Lecture 3)</span> <span class="date">due Monday, January 23</span></h2>
          <p>Read the page in Supplementary Materials, <a href="Candide%20quotes.html">Quotes from different critics about &quot;Il faut cultiver notre jardin.&quot;</a> Write a page which includes answers to the following questions: what are some  literal and figurative meanings of the word <em>garden</em>? How do they apply to Candide's garden? How do <strong>you</strong> interpret the final line of the story? </p>
          <p>To help you to understand the difference between <strong>literal</strong> and <strong>figurative</strong>, here is  an example I found online:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>literal</strong> vs. <strong>figurative</strong> meaning - relates to the meanings of words and phrases or expressions. For example, &quot;She was all ears&quot; has a <strong>figurative</strong> meaning (She was listening intently) as well as a <strong>literal</strong> meaning (Her body was composed of ears or she had a huge set of ears). <span class="citation"><a href="http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm">Literary Terms for English</a></span></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Read <em>A Short Guide</em>, Chapter 4 and write a summary to turn in. </p>

</ol>
<div class="maroon">
  <h3>FORMALIST CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Flaubert uses irony to show different ideas and attitudes the characters have. Give an example and explain its significance to the story.</li>
    <li>Emma is an anti-hero. An anti-hero is a hero with a flaw. What are some of Emma's flaws? Which flaw is the biggest/worst one?</li>
    <li>How is the character Homais tied into reinforcing the overall meaning intended by Flaubert in <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span>?</li>
    <li>How do the characters Emma, Charles, Léon, etc form and define the meaning of <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span>?</li>
    <li>How does the plot create meaning in <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span>?</li>
    <li>How do the different points of view relate to the organization of <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span>?</li>
    <li>In Chapter 1 of Part III, Emma tears up her letter on the carriage ride. What do you think this represents?</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
          <h3>SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
<div class="red">
  <h4>Marxist Criticism:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>In <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span>, are the characters aware of their different places/classes in society, how is it presented in their work and everyday life?</li>
              <li>Charles and Emma were both originally raised in two completely different social and economical classes. How does this affect the characters' lives later in the story when they are married?</li>
              <li>What do you think <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> says about the values of the 1850s? Does this relate to ideological values and the economic issues present?</li>
              <li>To Flaubert, bourgeois life was mundane—however, by having satirical characters such as Homais champion the working class, and using his depictions of various peasant characters in <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span>, can one draw a conclusion that he detested the proletariat as well? Or are the crude depictions of the peasant class more satirical of the social climate created by the bourgeoisie (and therefore made more ironic by a character like Homais singing the praises of the proletariat)?</li>
              <li>Much of the end of the story of <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> is centered on Emma Bovary's increasing debts and loans. How does the author criticize the economic system: Emma has to borrow money and has to keep borrowing money to pay the debts that she cannot repay?</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
<div class="purple">
  <h4>Feminist Criticism: </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>How are the lives of women and the lives of men portrayed in this time period? Compare them to how they are portrayed today.</li>
              <li>What are the relationships and differences between females in <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span>? For example, consider the actions/character of Emma in comparison to her mother-in-law and Madame Homais?</li>
              <li>Do you feel that Emma strives to be a man ( ie break away from womanly duties) or that she is used to being &quot;tied down&quot; and is just trying to rebel against society?</li>
              <li>It is clear that there is a distinction between how women's and men's lives are lived in <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span>. You can see this when Emma wants a boy rather than a girl when she is pregnant because she knows the boy would be able to live a better life. She even says, while talking to Léon, &quot;One can't afford to be self-indulgent if one has a thousand things to attend to.&quot; Léon responds, &quot;Oh, I can imagine. . .&quot; and Emma says, &quot;No, you can't; you're not a woman.&quot; Showing Emma's moral destruction, is Flaubert saying it is her fault because she is the one who chose to have affairs, she is the one that go herself and family into debt, she is the one who could have avoided all of this? Or is he showing how women of the 19th century felt trapped? That she had no choice, she wanted to be happy and fulfill her life and that was the only thing that could do it for her? Since she was basically only seen as an object of sexuality and beauty to all these men, was it good or bad that she took advantage of it? Or was it the men and the period's time for only giving her that choice?</li>
              <li>Describe the role of women in the novel? What can women in the novel do to make a living? List examples from the text.</li>
              <li>When looking at  two female characters of <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span>, Emma Bovary and Madame Homais, what attributes and characteristics do the women display to support or oppose the feminine role? How does each of these characters view the stereotyical position women were suppoed to fit into during this time period?</li>
              <li>Does Emma Bovary represent an ideal wife? Why or why not and what characteristics or examples clarify this?<br />
              </li>
  </ul>
  </div>
<div class="teal">
  <h3>CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Throughout <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span>, elements of a changing society can be seen through the blend of different characters. How did the periods of the Enlightenment, Romanticism, Realism and the French Revolution help to shape the characters and the plot of <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> and what did Gustave Flaubert think of each of these periods?</li>
    <li>How is Emma's tragedy a representation of a failed attempt of the new European middle class to join the elite in society?</li>
    <li>How does the plot of the novel represent the social situation and family dynamics of the time? List examples. </li>
    <li>How         was Flaubert mocking Romanticism through his work <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span>?</li>
    <li>How do you think <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> reflects the time period's view towards women?</li>
    <li>What do you think would happen to Emma if she were to run off Rodolphe? How would the society in the Realist period would react to this?</li>
    <li>If Emma really wanted to leave Charles, what are some ways that she could do this in the Realist Period? How would the society deal with divorces during the period?</li>
    <li>How does Flaubert address the different classes in the period? What are some examples that were included to point out the characteristics/separation between each class?</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
<div class="orange">
  <h3>PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Why do you think the author adds a character such as Rodolphe to the story? What does his personality say about wealthy men in these times?</li>
              <li>We know that Flaubert wrote <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> to show that people can be foolish and live in fantasy rather than the real world. He does this by portrarying the characters as fools and making us think the same way, but he also makes us feel bad for them as well. Can it be that he was going through the same thing Emma was, showing his alter ego?</li>
              <li>LIst situations from the novel that reflect the personality and character of Emma. What do they say about her personality?</li>
              <li>There are many psychological illnesses illustrated in <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> by Gustave Flaubert. What signs of these illnesses are found in the text and what do they say about the characters' psychological state?</li>
              <li>How does Charles' naïveté play a role in Emma's infidelities?</li>
              <li>What behavior and emotions does Madame Bovary display that reveal she is depressed and unhappy?</li>
              <li>What is revealed about Charles' personality when he is so ignorant of reality or the truth?</li>
              <li>It seems that throughout the novel Emme is unsure of what she really wants. She seems like she just wants a life of love, however, she finds that she actually wants more. She also wants a child, but is unhappy when it is a girl. Last, when her daughter seeks her mother, Emma is unable to accept her daughter, but somehow seems to show some sympathy after her daughter is hurt. These all can be signs of a psychological disorder. Do you think she shows signs of depression or bipolar disorder? Why do you think she cannot find a place in her life where she is truly happy? Explain.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
<div class="blue">
  <h3>READER RESPONSE CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How do your past relationships with the opposite sex affect how you read and interpret this text? Who is it that you are sympathizing more with, Charles or Emma?</li>
    <li>How do you think that Flaubert's past persuaded him to write <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span>? What did you see that made you think that?</li>
    <li>In <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span>, did you find any underlying meaning to the overall plot? Was there anything the author wanted the reader to take out of the reading?</li>
    <li>What is your response to marrying for love and/or money? Are love and money mutually exclusive, especially with Valentine's Day mostly being about buying gifts?</li>
    <li>Who do you think was Flabuert's intended audience for <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span>? Was it the Youth (20-30 year olds) or an older crowd? Do you think this was a risky story speaking of adultery during this time period?</li>

  <h3>ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>In what way(s) does Emma's environment contribute to her desires?</li>
              <li>On page 1195, in the 6th paragraph, there is clear imagery of realism (factory, smoke, etc). What roles, if any, do the natural images (wind, great black fish, etc.) play?</li>
              <li>How do the environmental elements that shape the different settings in <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> affect the characters within these different settings? For example, countryside vs city.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
<div class="fuchsia">
  <h3>QUEER THEORY: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Based on Emma's sexual tendencies to give her life some excitement, could it have been possible for Emma to be bisexual if the opportunity arose?</li>
              <li>Is Emma permanently messed up or can her wild lifestyle be fixed?</li>
              <li>How do Emma's relationships with men throughout the novel relate to the themes?</li>
              <li>During Flaubert's work, Madame Bovary is repeatedly unfaithful to Charles. Is this infidelity brought on by her need to find real love and happiness or just Madame's need to be sexually deviant?</li>

<p>Now answer your own question, or another student's (see below), based on the <strong>whole</strong> story.

<div class="maroon">
  <h3>FORMALIST CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How does Gregory's transformation relate to the overall theme of the story?</li>
    <li>Is the metamorphosis of the main character what drives the plot of the story?</li>
    <li>How does Gregor's current state of being reflect the pressures caused by work, home, and social obligations and responsibilities?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h3>SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
<div class="red">
  <h4>Marxist Criticism:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>How do economic conditions determine the characters' lives in <em>The Metamorphosis</em>?</li>
    <li>How does the economic situation of Gregor's family relate to his bodily changes and isolation from other people?</li>
    <li>What social class would Gregory's family be a part of? Does Gregory having to work help you determine their class?</li>
    <li>Based on the description of Gregor's job and how he was treated by his supervisors, it can be argued that he had always been considered an insect long before his literal transformation (ie a worker bee, an ant, a mindless drone). In portraying Gregor in such a way, was Kafka making a statement about how Capitalism affects workers, or do you think he was singling out Gregor as psychologically insectoid? In other words, was it society that made the insect or was it just him?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="purple">
  <h4>Feminist Criticism: </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Which woman in this story is empowered?</li>
    <li>What are the roles of the women in this story?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="teal">
  <h3>CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How does the cultural context of eastern Europe and the new World War relate to the characteristics of <span class="text">The Metamorphosis</span>?</li>
    <li>How important is knowing the historical contexts (both the work's and your own) in interpreting the work?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="orange">
  <h3>PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How does Gregory's voice being unrecognizable by human beings affect his feelings and actions toward the situation?</li>
    <li>How does Gregory's family's emotions and behaviors change as a result of his transformation?</li>
    <li>How did Gregory's family change after his transformation into an insect?</li>
    <li>What does Gregor's transformation reveal about how he thinks about himself?</li>
    <li>Gregory's life is simple and complicated. He is a workaholic, because he is the only one (he thinks) that can provide for his family. When he wakes up and realizes that he is a monstruous vermin, he doesn't react the way most people would. Instead, he accepts it and begins to explore, something he didn't do when he was human. Is this some sort of alter ego of his?</li>
    <li>How does Gregory's current state as a monstruous vermin isolated in his bedroom relate to his everyday life as a traveling salesperson?</li>
    <li>Franz Kafka's stories reflect &quot;heroes&quot; that struggle to &quot;…prevail against a vast, meaningless, and apparently hostile system (Norton p. 1966). In your opinion, how is the transformation of Gregory Samsa into a monstruous vermin related to the hardships that Franz Kafka suffered as a child? In other works, how is Kafka expressing his hardships through the life of Gregory Samsa?</li>
    <li>How does the work reflect the author's personal psychology?</li>
    <li>In the first half of the work, how does the transformation of Gregory reflect the author's personal psychology?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="blue">
  <h3>READER RESPONSE CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How do you think Franz's life influenced aspects of <em>The Metamorphosis</em>?</li>
    <li>How do you respond to the opening line of <em>The Metamorphosis</em>?</li>
    <li>Do you think Kafka wrote this for any particular reason? Why do you think so?</li>
    <li>Many changes have occurred in the family after Gregory's transformation. Is there a parallel in Gregory's appearance and personality change with the changes his family went through?</li>
    <li>Similar to Gregor's condition, have you ever felt like &quot;the bug&quot; in the room or in a situation with either peers or family? In your opinion, why is Gregor so alientated from his family and other people in general?</li>
    <li>How do you respond to the work?</li>
    <li>After reading the first section of <em>The Metamorphosis</em>, how do you feel about the author transforming the main character into an insect? Do you feel that this transformation is morally correct in the sense of story or should the author have come up with another form instead?</li>
    <li>How did you respond to the opening scene of the story and what did it set you up to expect from the remainder of the story? </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="green">

<h2><span class="class">Class 35 (Thesis exercise and Peer review of Term Paper) </span><span class="date">due Monday, April 9</span></h2>
<p>The first part of class will be devoted to <em>The Thesis Exercise</em>. Read the <a href="222Thesis exercise.html">web page</a> about how to write a thesis for a literary paper. Print and fill out the <a href="222Theses.html">page of sample FL 222 theses</a> where you rate the examples. The second half of class will be devoted to peer review of the first draft of your <a href="222Paper2010.html">Paper</a>. Print out <strong>two copies</strong> of the <a href="Peerevaluation2.pdf">Peer Review Feedback Form</a> to include with the <strong>two copies</strong> of your draft which you will bring for your classmates. Fill out the top part of the form with your name, paper title, and date. Do <strong>not wait</strong> until the last minute to print these materials out. Email me before class if you have an idea for your own original topic so that I can approve it. Speaking of original, a very creative paper where almost all the main characters meet in Hell written by a former student is featured <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~dsbeckma/To Hell with Literature.htm"> here</a>, and my favorite missing chapter of <em>Candide</em> is <a href="222VoltaireCandide.html">here</a>: </p>
<p>Selected writing advice from the <a href="222Paper2010.html">Term Paper page:</a></p>
<h3>Choose your topic</h3>
<p>Read through the topic choices below. Consult Chapter 10 in <span class="text"> A Short Guide, Writing about Fiction: the World of the Story</span>, especially the pages on &quot;Getting Ideas&quot; (171-5).  Which texts have been your favorite or challenged you the most? Send me an email or make an appointment if you need help deciding on a topic. </p>
<h3>Steps for writing </h3>
<p>Step 1: read, re-read and annotate your texts; write preliminary notes; build up to a fully formulated thesis. A thesis is a clear and specific argument, not a list, not an opinion, not an obvious fact.</p>
<p>See the <a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/course/FL/222">Library Tools</a> page to see resources available to you from NCSU libraries. </p>
<p>Step 2: Following <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>, Chapter 3; write a first draft of 1-2 pages about one of the topics below for the peer review session. It should have a working title and a fully formulated introduction (you can rewrite them later, but they need to be there for the draft) and several finished paragraphs; your audience knows the text, so you should avoid plot summaries. Use the present tense for literary analysis: Ivan <strong>is</strong> an ambitious&hellip; Flaubert <strong>reveals</strong>&hellip; Include your outline. This is the peer review draft version of your paper; print and bring 2 copies of it to class. Include the <a href="Peerevaluation2.pdf">Peer Review Feedback form</a> with each copy.</p>
<p>Some useful pages (among many) about writing:</p>
<ul>
  <li> For the difference between formal and informal style: <a href="http://www.mondofacto.com/study-skills/writing/how-to-use-academic-writing-style/04.html">http://www.mondofacto.com/study-skills/writing/how-to-use-academic-writing-style/04.html</a>.</li>
  <li>For guidelines about  commas, see <a href="http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/commas.html">http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/commas.html</a></li>
  <li>For writing anxiety or writer's block, see <a href="http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/writing_anxiety.html">http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/writing_anxiety.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. Beckman's hint about titles: A dull title sets expectations low. A good title invites the reader! Quotes, proverbs or aphorisms make great titles. Try a google search with a key word from your thesis (pride, satisfaction, quest, etc) and the word quote. I've already got a <a href="222Lovequotes.html">web page</a> with love quotes for you to use, since love is such a popular topic. </p>
<p>Post due at midnight: oc on Proust</p>
<h2><span class="class">Class 36 (Woolf 1)</span><span class="date"> due Wednesday, April 11</span></h2>
<p>See lecture notes <a href="222VirginiaWoolf.htm">Virginia Woolf and Feminism: a few quotes to consider</a>.</p>
<p>Choose the most provocative or thought-provoking statement in <strong>Chapter 2</strong> (ie not Chapter 1) of the assignment. Include the page number. Write a paragraph (or more) agreeing or disagreeing. Be prepared to read your passage out loud in class and explain why you think it is provocative or thought-provoking.</p>

<p><span class="red">Alert: Class will be meeting at IHOP on Hillsborough Street today!</span> I will be taking roll and collecting homework. You'll be discussing your answers to the following 3 questions and writing up a group report. I will have some additional passages for you to discuss from Chapter 3 of <span class="text">A Room of One's Own</span> and <span class="text">An Unwritten Novel</span>.<br />
</p>
<p>Writing Assignment (answer all 3 questions):</p>
<ol>
  <li> Who is Judith Shakespeare? Why does Woolf create her? What is the message about women and women writers that Woolf suggests by telling Judith's story? Is Judith fact, fiction, truth, a lie?</li>
  <li> Choose any work we've read so far and speculate about how it might have been different if the work had been written by a woman rather than a man. (There is no right or wrong answer: let your imagination take you somewhere. Would the characters be different? The plot? The ending? How does the author's gender impact his or her art?)</li>
  <li> List 3 elements of <a href="222Modernism.html">modernism</a> that you can find in our example of Virginia Woolf's fiction, the very short story, <span class="text">An Unwritten Novel</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="red"> Helpful synopsis of the story and main ideas:</span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> &quot;The narrator, while riding in a train, imagines possible characters and plots for a novel, based on her observations of another passenger whom she calls 'Minnie Marsh.' The narrative alternates between imaginative creation and objective observation, leading the narrator to unexpected discoveries about herself and the nature of art and artistic representation.&quot; <span class="citation"><a href="http://fajardo-acosta.com/worldlit/woolf/unwritten_novel.htm">Fidel Fajardo-Acosta</a></span></p></blockquote>

<h2><span class="class">Class 39 (Paper Full Draft)</span><span class="date"> due Wednesday, April 18</span></h2>
<p>No class meeting, but  come to the classroom to drop off the complete draft of your paper along with your peer review drafts. See the <a href="222Paper2010.html">Paper</a> page for full details.
  Highlights include:</p>
<p>-Step 3: Reflect on your peer reviewers' suggestions and write a full draft of your paper to turn in to me. Proofread following the <span class="text">Editing</span> and other checklists listed on the inside cover of <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>. I will not grade the paper at this point but will return it to you with comments, so that you can write the final draft. Consult the <a href="222scoringrubric.html">Scoring Rubric for Papers</a> and <a href="222scoringrubric-rewrite.html">Scoring Rubric for Creative Papers</a> so that you'll know what I will be looking for when I do grade the paper.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Chapter 14 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> is an exellent presentation of the style and format I expect in  a literary paper. Pay attention to good organization and logical transitions between paragraphs.</li>
  <li>Base your arguments on close readings of the texts you have chosen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two areas that are normally weak in the first draft are the use of quotations and the conclusion.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Give concrete examples (quotes) from 
    the texts to support your arguments, but not to fill up space.  These quotations are the evidence you need to provide to prove your thesis. You will usually use at least one in each of body paragraphs.</li>
  <li>In order to integrate quotes appropriately, first introduce the quote by making the point, connected to your thesis, that the passage illustrates. Next, include the quote, usually 3-5 lines of text. Finally, tie the quote back into your argument with a concluding sentence in your own words: &quot;&hellip;remind your reader that these passages are there to prove a point. End your discussion on your words, not theirs.&quot; (Shannon, 162-3).</li>
</ul>
<p>A conclusion is very important to a fully developed paper. Go beyond the ideas in your introduction. Have you proved your thesis?  All readers, including your professor, will ask the question: &quot;So what?&quot; The conclusion should make the relevance and importance of your research clear.</p>
<p>You are not required to use secondary sources (books, articles, internet) for this paper, but if you do, be sure to quote and document them properly and attach a &#147;Works Cited&#148; page. <strong>Plagiarism is a poor choice and will not be tolerated</strong>; consult the <a href="222CIsp11.html">Course Information</a> page about the NC State academic integrity policy; ask me if questions remain. For information on using research (if you do) and writing the documentation page, consult <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>, chapter 17.</p>

  <b>PLACEMENT AND PREREQUISITES</b>: A score of 10-21/ 165-279 on the NCSU Placement 
  Test is required. The Placement Test can be taken in the Foreign Language Technology 
  Center (214 Laundry Bldg). The test will take 20-25 minutes and you will receive 
  the results immediately. This course is designed for the student who has had 
  at least 1-2 years in high school and would like a refresher of the 101 material 
  before doing the 102 material. It is not for the student who has not had French 
previously. <strong>The time commitment outside of class is significant</strong>.</font></p>
<p class="style22"><strong><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENT</font></strong><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">: <strong>Foreign Language Proficiency for Graduation</strong><br>
  If eligible, upon admission to NC State, all students are notified during New Student Orientation and will receive a notation on their Automated Degree Audit (ADA) stating that they have met the university foreign language proficiency requirement &ndash; the &ldquo;equivalent&rdquo; of FL 102 / FL Elementary II &ndash; as &ldquo;FL* 100 High School *** PF.&rdquo;<br>
  <br>
  <b>LEARNING OUTCOMES</b>: At the end of this course, students will be able to:<br>
  1. use learned grammatical structures to speak and write in elementary or novice-level 
  French; <br>
  2. create written and oral sentences using learned vocabulary;<br>
  3. read French at the elementary or novice level;<br>
  4. understand spoken French at the elementary or novice level;<br>
  5. identify aspects of the cultures of the French-speaking world.<br>
  <br>
  <b>WELCOME TO FRENCH!</b> This course aims at giving you a solid foundation 
  in understanding, speaking, reading and writing the French language at the elementary 
  level. To accomplish these goals, it is essential that we use French as the 
  language of the classroom. Handy phrases for communicating in French: <br>
  <font color="#FF0000"><i>R&eacute;p&eacute;tez, s'il vous pla&icirc;t</i></font>. 
  = Repeat, please.<br>
  <font color="#FF0000"><i>Une minute, s'il vous pla&icirc;t</i></font>.= Wait 
  a minute, please.<br>
  <font color="#FF0000"><i>Comment dit-on [English word] en fran&ccedil;ais</i></font>? 
  = How do you say [English word] in French.?<br>
  <i><font color="#FF0000">Que veut dire [French word]</font></i>?= What does 
  [French word] mean ?<br>
  <font color="#FF0000"><i>Qu'est-ce que c'est?</i></font> = What's that?<br>
  <font color="#FF0000"><i>Je ne sais pas</i></font>. = I don't know.<br>
  <font color="#FF0000"><i>Je ne comprends pas</i></font>. = I don't understand.<br>
  <br>
  I will do my best to keep the class atmosphere creative, lively, and accepting 
  of your best efforts. In return, you, too have some responsibilities. Please 
  read carefully and follow the information and advice given below. <br>
  <br>
  <b>GRADING</b>: Your grade in this course will be computed as follows: <br>
  Participation, Class Work 25 %<br>
  Homework (Green pages, Lab manual, <em>English Grammar for Students of French</em>), Quizzes, Film Assignment, Presentation 25 %<br>
  Exams 25 %<br>
  Final Exam 25 %<br>
  <br>
  There will be plus/minus grading in this class. The scale will be as follows:<br>
  A+ = 97.0-100, A = 93.0-96.9, A- = 90.0-92.9, <br>
  B+ = 87.0-89.9, B = 83.0-86.9, B- = 80.0-82.9, <br>
  C+ = 77.0-79.9, C = 73.0-76.9, C- = 70.0-72.9, <br>
  D+ = 67.0-69.9, D = 63.0-66.9, D- = 60.0-62.9,<br>
  F = 59.9 and below.<br>
  <br>
  <b>ATTENDENCE REGULATIONS</b>: Attendance is required and will be taken daily. 
  Missing class will seriously hinder your ability to succeed in this class. The 
  following penalty will be applied: after three absences, your class participation 
  will be lowered one grade (from A to A-, from B+ to B, etc.) for EACH absence 
  beyond the limit. <br>
  <br>
  See me as soon as possible after an absence and provide a written excuse to 
  be accepted at my discretion (in case of illness, injury, death or illness in 
  the family, university duties, court attendance, or religious observance.) This 
  policy is based upon the University Attendance Policy at <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/academic_affairs/pols_regs/REG205.00.4.php">http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/academic_affairs/pols_regs/REG205.00.4.php</a><br>
  <br>
  If you need to miss a class for one of the reasons listed above, let me know 
  before the class meeting, if possible. Save your absences for emergencies. <strong>Excessive 
    absences may lead to an F for the course</strong>. Upon your return to class, you are 
  responsible for all work missed and for any assignments announced during your 
  absence. I suggest that you get the name and phone number or IM of a classmate 
  in the event that you are unsure of an assignment.<br>
  <br>
  <b>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY</b>: The Foreign Language Department takes the University Policy on Academic Integrity very seriously. If you do not already have the pamphlet explaining this NCSU policy, ask your advisor for one. In accordance with this policy, you will be required to sign the Honor Pledge on every exam that you take in this class. The Honor Pledge reads: &quot;I have neither given nor received any unauthorized aid on this test.&quot; The Code of Student Conduct is located at <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/student_services/student_discipline/POL11.35.1.php">http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/student_services/student_discipline/POL11.35.1.php</a><br>
  <br>
  <b>EXAMS AND QUIZZES</b>: There will be 5-minute verbs quizzes at the <strong>beginning</strong> of class throughout the semester, announced at the previous class meeting, and five class-long exams as well as an individual oral exam at midterm and a  
  final exam, all listed on the <a href="110syfa07.html">Syllabus</a>. There will be no make-up quizzes. However, I will drop your lowest 
  quiz grade. Make-up for exams will be granted only if you are excused in advance 
  with proper documentation. <br>
  <br>
&#149; The oral part of the final exam will be given during the last week of 
  classes before final exams. Note the dates on the syllabus. <br>
  <br>
  <b>HOMEWORK</b>: Each module of the textbook is divided into two parts: 1) White 
  Pages (<i>Th&egrave;mes, Pratiques de conversation, Perspectives 
    culturelles, &Eacute;coutons ensemble, Lecture, Expression &eacute;crite</i>) and 2) Green Pages (<i>Structures</i> <em>utiles</em>) <br>
  <br>
  Before each class, read through the white pages so you know what 
  we will be doing in class. There are also writing exercises for the readings  in the white pages to write out and turn in which are listed on the second column of the syllabus. I will correct these. (If you are having trouble with the reading questions, try writing out the question and translating it into English. I'll correct that, too.) You also need to write out the answers to exercises in the green 
  pages. Check this work using Appendix B (page 485 in the textbook). All exercises 
  should be corrected clearly in a different color. If there are no errors, just put a check mark so I know that you've corrected your work. You will turn in the corrected 
  work from the green pages daily and all other written assignments  when 
  indicated on the syllabus. <b>Full credit will be given only for corrected work turned in on time.</b> <br>
  <br>
  On your own, you will also do the written exercises assigned in the Workbook 
  and the <i>Activit&eacute;s de compr&eacute;hension et de prononication</i> in the Lab Manual corresponding to each Module. Suggested completion dates are 
  indicated on the syllabus.  Correct your Workbook/Lab Manual exercises 
  using the <a href="MotifsWB_AnswerKey.pdf">WorkbookAnswer Key pdf</a> and the <a href="Motifs 4e Lab Manual Answer Key-2.pdf">LabManualAnswer Key.pdf</a>.  All exercises should be corrected clearly in a different 
  color. Mark any sections you don't understand so that you can ask about them 
  in class or I can explain when I'm correcting your work. <b>Bring your Workbook/Lab 
    Manual to each exam so that I can give you credit for your work. </b>You will 
  get full credit (10 points) for complete and corrected (in a different color) 
  exercises and partial credit (5 points) for uncorrected exercises or late lab work.<br>
  <br>
  Exercises in the Lab Manual are to be completed with the audio available in 
the Language Lab and online. See the section <b>Language Lab</b> below. </font></p>
<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On your own, you will also read and do the self-correcting exercises in <em>English Grammar for Students of French</em>. The sections which correlate to the grammar we are studying in <em>Motifs </em>is listed in the <a href="motifs.pdf">Correlation Guide pdf</a>. The completed and corrected exercises are due each exam day for full credit (5 points). <br>
  <br>
  We will cover Modules 1-11 in FLF 110. <br>
  <br>
<b>WRITTEN WORK</b>: </font></p>
<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Please <strong>skip lines</strong> on all written assignments whether handwritten or typed.<br>
  <br>
  <b>DO</b> use regular or online dictionaries to find French 
      or English equivalents for individual words. For example: <br>
      <a href="http://www.wordreference.com/">http://www.wordreference.com/</a><br>

<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The University of Chicago site also has a handy French verb conjugator:<br>

  <br>
  However, do <b>NOT</b> use online translators for phrases or sentences for written 
          assignments. The results are poor and will violate Academic Integrity (see above).<br>
  <br>
      <b>COMPOSITIONS</b> <i>Expression &eacute;crite </i>(in textbook) and <i>Synth&egrave;se </i>(in workbook )<br>
  You will write a double-spaced, word-processed composition for each Module, 
submitting a first draft and final version for each. The due date for the first 
draft is indicated on the syllabus. Learn to type accents on your computer. 
You will find an explanation of how to do this on the <a href="110supp.htm">Supplementary Materials</a> page. You may submit your compositions to me by email, using a Word attachment. 
      They must be received by the time class starts on the day the composition is 
      due. Drafts will be returned with corrections indicated. Please note: use of 
      on-line translators for writing assignments is not allowed. Compositions will be graded using the <a href="110writingassessment.html">Writing Assessment Rubric</a>. <br>
  <br>
      <b>LANGUAGE LAB</b>: You have three options for obtaining the audio material needed 
          to complete the comprehension and pronunciation exercises in the Lab manual. 
The most convenient is to<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> listen to the audio online, using WebCT. To access WebCT, go to <a href="http://vista.ncsu.edu">http://vista.nscu.edu</a> and log in with your Unity ID and password. Once logged in, you will be brought to your <b>my Courses </b> page. Beneath the Courses header you will find links to the home pages of classes in which you are enrolled that are using WebCT. Click on FLF 110. This will take you to the FL 110 home page. For your first visit to WebCT Vista, please click on the Student Orientation. Read <em>Getting Started with WebCT Vista</em>, Section 1. </font></font></p>
<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the home page, you will also find the Motifs Online Audio Icon where you can download the audio for each Module in our textbook. There is also a link for downloading Realplayer, so you can listen to the audio. There is also  a link on the home page to the Course Information for this class. </font></p>
<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For help with WebCT Vista, follow the Help links or call 515-HELP.</font></p>
<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You may also go to the Foreign Language Technology Center and listen to the audio 
  there while completing the exercises in the Lab Manual, or you may have the 
  material copied on to a cassette tape to listen to at home. To do so, bring 
  one or two 90-minute blank tapes of good quality (TDK, Maxell, Sony) to the 
  Language Lab and indicate which Module you wish recorded. You will be told when 
  you can pick up the recorded lesson. Copyright restrictions forbid taping all 
  of the lessons at once. You will therefore use the same one or two audio tapes 
for the entire semester; succeeding lessons are taped over the previous ones. </font></p>

  <b>FILM</b>: You are required to watch one of two French films with English 
  subtitles, <i>Am&eacute;lie</i> or <i>Le D&icirc;ner de Cons</i> and complete 
  a written assignment. See your syllabus for dates and times of the film showings 
  and the assignment deadlines. The <a href="filmsheet.html">Film Study Sheet</a> should be used for this assignment and can be submitted for any other French film for extra credit. You can rent films locally and view or check them out from the Media Center in DH Hill Library. Here's how to find out which French films are in the Media Center: <br>

  HOW TO DO WELL IN CLASS</b>: <br>
  <br>
  1) <b>Prepare assignments before coming to class</b> so we can get the most 
  out of our class time together. Assignments are to be completed as indicated 
  on the syllabus. It is nearly impossible to &#147;cram&#148; for this course 
  and do well. Learning a language is like building a house of cards: each one 
  must be well in place before adding the next. I urge you to spend at least 30 
  minutes on French per day, rather than studying all at once before exams. Regular 
  repetition of small quantities of information is the most successful method 
  for learning a foreign language.<br>
  <br>
  2) <b>Participate actively</b> in each lesson. Mentally answer each and every 
  question when a classmate is responding. Class participation and homework make 
  up 25% of your grade. The more you participate, the better your grade will be, 
  and the better your French will become. Your class grade reflects your performance 
  in class (attendance, knowledge of daily lesson, volunteering answers, asking 
  questions, class reflections). Take listening comprehension seriously &#151; it will help both your proficiency and your grade (there is a listening component 
  on exams). <br>
  <br>
  3) <b>Take risks</b>. Speak out. Don&#146;t be afraid to make mistakes. I am 
  here to help. The more you speak, the more you will get out of the class. Save perfection for exams. The desire to communicate is the most important 
  consideration when speaking. <br>
  <br>
  4) <b>Speak French as much as possible</b> in the classroom. Speak French outside 
  the classroom whenever possible, too. Listen to French music, go to French movies, 
  eat French food!<br>
  <br>
  5) <b>Bring textbook to class every day</b>. This is essential. You should also 
  purchase a decent quality French/English-English/French dictionary. While not 
  required, it will help you find words not explained in the textbook. <br>
  <br>
  6) <b>Take notes</b> in class whenever appropriate. Buy 3x5 notecards to make 
  personalized verb charts and other study aids. Study with a friend
  outside of class. <br>
  <br>
  I look forward to a pleasant and productive semester! Don't hesitate to ask 
  me for help and assistance in person or by email.<br>

  My personal teaching philosophy is reflected in this quotation from educator 
  Haim Ginnott (1922-1973):<br>
&#147;It&#146;s my personal approach that creates the climate. It&#146;s my 
  daily mood that makes the weather. As a teacher, I possess a tremendous power 
  to make a student&#146;s life miserable or joyous. I can be a tool of torture 
  or an instrument of inspiration. I can humiliate or humor, hurt or heal. In 
  all situations, it is my response that decides whether a crisis will be escalated 
  or deescalated and a student humanized or dehumanized.&#148; </font></p>

<p align="center">Preface to &ldquo;Metamorphosis&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His dreams were far from easy.&nbsp; But it was not a dream.&nbsp; Gregory Samsa went through a very strange and unfortunate transformation, which would dreadfully lead to his demise.&nbsp; But why did this happen to Gregory?&nbsp; He was in no way deserving of such unwanted change.&nbsp; He had been a workhorse, laboring to relieve the debts of his seemingly helpless family.&nbsp; They were capable of supporting themselves, but they did not.&nbsp; They chose time and time again to rely on young Gregory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There seemed to be no explanation for this sudden transfiguration.&nbsp; A human, and a son, transformed to a bug, vermin.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a beautiful, sunny day; a day comparable to typical paradise weather.&nbsp; It was warm, sunny, but with a soft, cool breeze.&nbsp; Gregory had no desire to work.&nbsp; He had nothing, but relaxation on his mind.&nbsp; He snuck out of work early.&nbsp; There is no telling how he got past his boss.&nbsp; This was one feat, but getting out the door of the building was a bigger feat.&nbsp; Winston was a co-worker who never liked Gregory.&nbsp; The reasoning was uncertain because Gregory was sure he hadn&rsquo;t done anything to trouble their relations.&nbsp; Still, Gregory was to make sure he would dodge sight of Winston or such workers who could not but keeps a secret.&nbsp; The only way for Gregory to escape was to rush to the exit door and flee the grounds without looking back.&nbsp; He knew there would be some are to hear the door creak out and slam shut, but if he fled quick enough it was his only chance of circumventing trouble.&nbsp; Would they notice his absence?&nbsp; Of course not.&nbsp; No one cared much for Gregory.&nbsp; Who would check on him throughout the day?&nbsp; Not one person, other than his boss.&nbsp; He, however, only came to see Gregory in the morning before his boss actually started what little work he did.&nbsp; Even if someone came to check on him, Gregory did not care.&nbsp; He wanted freedom.&nbsp; He wanted a better life.&nbsp; This, however, was the last thing in his future.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gregory reached the noisy train station just as paradise turned into its opposite.&nbsp; Dark, gray clouds stormed through the vast skies.&nbsp; With the clouds, came rain.&nbsp; When the rain came, the streets cleared, but Gregory remained.&nbsp; He meandered through the streets expecting to be alone.&nbsp; Unbeknownst to him, he wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Before he could even see it coming, it happened.&nbsp; Who or what it was was a mystery.&nbsp; A pain, and then Gregory was unconscious.&nbsp; He was just like a corpse lying on the ground, never to stand again. Sometime he would live again, but never would he be able to stand upright again.&nbsp; Some men hurriedly concealed Gregory in a large box and left the area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were an unknown agency. Governmental or not, this was an agency which looked to do nothing but harm.&nbsp; They took from others the resources they knew would benefit themselves.&nbsp; Gregory had no recollection where he was taken, for he had only been conscious for a few moments before the agency officials opened his box.&nbsp; They brought him inside the building as the rained poured down in sheets.&nbsp; Gregory was weak, both mentally and physically.&nbsp; He was dazed, barely comprehending what was happening around him.&nbsp; He looked unconcerned with what was transposing.&nbsp; The lightning and thunder which flashed and crashed above had no effect on Gregory.&nbsp; He was motionless as he was carried into the musty, cool building.&nbsp; It was an old wine cellar, hidden beneath ground level.&nbsp; There was no wine in this cellar anymore.&nbsp; Gregory quickly noted the empty racks and felt the cool damp chill of the room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gregory had spent much time in deep thought in recent times.&nbsp; His life was in no way anything near to what he had planned it to be.&nbsp; But was he willing to throw this life away for another one?&nbsp; Could he let go of the blood and flesh that created him?&nbsp; A life on his own was very tempting, but Gregory was strong.&nbsp; So strong he couldn&rsquo;t be forced into it. Tortured, beaten, and emotionally torn, Gregory did not give in.&nbsp; Giving them no choice, the agency men had only one choice.&nbsp; One of the three agency men nodded his head to the lone man in the corner of the room.&nbsp; The man in the corner stood up.&nbsp; He had no reply; he just nodded back.&nbsp; He reached down and grabbed his black briefcase and slowly walked toward the table where Gregory was sitting.&nbsp; He put the briefcase on the table and unlocked the latches.&nbsp; The agency officials left, except for one.&nbsp; The official that remained strapped Gregory down, and followed the others.&nbsp; The lone man from the corner opened his briefcase.&nbsp; Gregory could not turn far enough to see the inside of the briefcase because he was restrained by the straps.&nbsp; He began to worry, almost in a panicking way.&nbsp; He could hear the man fumbling with objects in the briefcase, but Gregory had no clues about what would become of him.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gregory opened his eyes after closing them for an unknown amount of time.&nbsp; When his eyes opened the man was standing in front of him with an object in his hand.&nbsp; Gregory, who hadn&rsquo;t fully awakened from his short slumber, could not make out the object.&nbsp; Gregory quickly noticed bugs crawling all over the table.&nbsp; Soon, they were crawling on Gregory.&nbsp; He began to panic again.&nbsp; Not a second or two later, did he feel a pinch on his arm.&nbsp; A moment later, he was unconscious once again.</p>

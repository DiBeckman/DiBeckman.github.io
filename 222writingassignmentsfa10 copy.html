<h1>Daily Writing Assignments and Lecture Notes Links<br />
  FALL 2010 </h1>
<p class="style14">For each class, go directly to the <a href="222syfa10.html">Syllabus</a> to see  the reading assignment that accompanies these writing assignments.</p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style7">Class 2: (Pope, Lecture 1)</span> <span class="style13">due Friday, August 20 </span><br />
  Read the argument (summary) and first stanza of Pope's <em>Essay on Man</em>. Write a page about the first stanza (lines 1-16) answering Shannon's 4 questions*. <br />
  What is confusing?<br />
  What is repeated?<br />
  What is familiar?<br />
  What is strange?</p>
<p class="style14">*This and all subsequent references to Shannon are from  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Edward Shannon's</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="style14"><i> The Prentice Hall Guide to Writing about Literature</i> (Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2002)</span></font> which went out of print in 2010. I have replaced it with <em>A Short Guide</em> this semester. <br />
  <br />
Print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222Enlightenment.html">The Enlightenment</a> and <a href="222GreatChain.html">The Great Chain of Being</a> </p>
<p class="style14">In addition, for this and the next assignment, take a look at  my web page on <a href="Explication.html"><em>Explication de Texte</em></a> and these web sites about figures of speech which are also listed on the handy <a href="222supmatf04.html">Supplementary Materials</a> page.<font color="#990000"><font color="#000000"> These pages will  be useful for your <a href="222poetrypresentation.html">Poetry Presentation</a> due</font></font><span class="style13"> Friday, September 10 </span><font color="#990000"><span class="style43"><font color="#000000">and </font></span></font><span class="style43"><span class="style13">Monday, September 13 </span></span></p>
<p class="style14"><font color="#990000"><span class="style43"><font color="#000000">Here is a link to a quiz you can take to assess your knowledge of the &quot;Top 20 figures of speech&quot; by Richard Norquist: <a href="http://grammar.about.com/od/terms/a/revquiz20terms.htm?p=1">http://grammar.about.com/od/terms/a/revquiz20terms.htm?p=1</a><br />
  </font><br />
  <font color="#000000">&bull;</font><font color="#000000"> <a href="http://www.nipissingu.ca/faculty/williams/figofspe.htm">http://www.nipissingu.ca/faculty/williams/figofspe.htm</a><br />
    This site contains figures of speech, thought, repetition, more than you can shake a stick at! Most examples are drawn from Shakespeare. </font></span></font></p>
<p class="style14">&bull; <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/rhetoricaldevicesinsound.htm">http://www.americanrhetoric.com/rhetoricaldevicesinsound.htm<br />
</a>This site is very cool because it has sound clips and draws from a wide range of speeches, movies, and more to illustrate the Figures of Speech. For example, see and listen to quotes from Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln, and Neil Armstrong on the page about antitheses: <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/figures/antithesis.htm">http://www.americanrhetoric.com/figures/antithesis.htm</a></p>
<p class="style1"><span class="style7">Class 3: (Pope, Lecture 2) </span><span class="style13">due Monday, August 23 <br />
      <span class="style41">1) Print out <a href="AcademicIntegrityPledge.html">Academic Integrity form</a>. Please sign, date  
        and turn it in. </span></span> <br />
          <br />
  2) Read <em>Essay on Man</em> and write a page about your stanza to turn in. In case you're not sure what a <em>stanza</em> is, you can look this and other literary terms up in our course <a href="222Glossary.html">Glossary</a>, the Glossary in Appendix B of <em>A Short Guide to Writing About Literature</em>, or a web site such as <a href="http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms.html">http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms.html</a> . </p>
<p class="style1"> Note that the Roman numerals I-X at the beginning of each stanza correspond to your assigned stanza number (not a page or line number). What is the stanza about? Give a one sentence summary. Answer the <span class="style14">Shannon's </span>4 questions. Also, what are the key words and images in the stanza? How does the stanza connect with the ideas of the Enlightenment we've discussed? What is  the attitude of the narrator? What is the role of nature, especially animals, if any appear in your stanza?</p>
<p class="style1">3) Read Chapters 1 and 2 in <em>A Short Guide to Writing About Literature </em></p>
<p class="style1">4) <span class="style14">Your first Moodle post is due at midnight on Monday. <br />
Instructions: Login to <a href="http://moodle.wolfware.ncsu.edu/">http://moodle.wolfware.ncsu.edu/</a>. 
<br />
Enter your Unity ID and Password. <br />
If you are new to Moodle, visit Moodle Student Orientation under Learning With Moodle: A Student's Guide to Learning with Moodle. <br />
On your My Courses page, click on FL 222. <br />
To see the first discussion assignment, go to Block 4, Discussion Topics. <br />
Click on Introductions.<br />
You will see the prompt I have posted: Please introduce yourself to the rest of the class and tell us: if you could invite any three people, alive, dead or fictional, to dinner at your place, whom would you invite, why, and what would you serve?</span></p>
<p class="style14">5) See the <a href="Type/ExtraCreditType.html">Extra Credit Assignment on <em>Myers-Briggs Type in College</em></a> I'm INFJ. If you have comments or questions about Myers-Briggs Type, feel free to share them as part of the introduction. You can do this assignment any time in the first month of classes. </p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style7">Class 4 (Voltaire, Lecture 1)</span> <span class="style13">due Wednesday, August 25 </span><br />
    <br />
  1) Print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222ShortStoryNovel.html">Different Forms of Prose Fiction</a>; <a href="222SatireIronyUtopia.html">Satire, Irony and Utopia</a>. Read <a href="222Panglossian.htm">Panglossian</a>. <br />
  <br />
  2) Write a page about the first thirteen chapters of <em>Candide</em> answering Shannon's 4 questions. </p>
<p class="style14">3) Read Chapter 10 in <em>A Short Guide</em>. </p>
<p class="style1">3) Weekly vocabulary quizzes? I recommend that you sign up for the free edition of Anu Gang's A Word a Day at: <a href="http://wordsmith.org/awad/subscribe.html">http://wordsmith.org/awad/subscribe.html</a><br />
  Last semester, a student volunteer prepared a 5-question matching quiz based on the week's words that was posted on the board each Friday. He received a bonus of 2 points on his final grade for writing and bringing the quizzes to class each Friday. Students wrote the answers to the quiz on their homework and I added a point on the midterm or final each time a student got 3 quizzes completely correct. We will do this again provided I have a volunteer quiz-meister. <a href="mailto:Diane_Beckman@ncsu.edu">Email</a> me if you are interested: first come, first served. </p>
<p class="style1">4) Consider bookmarking an online dictionary or two to make it easy to look up words you don't know. If you are doing the Reading Notebook, you can print out the definitions to include in your notebook. If there's a dictionary you like better, please let me know. <br />
  <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/">http://dictionary.reference.com/</a><br />
  <a href="http://www.m-w.com/">http://www.m-w.com/</a></p>
<p class="style1">Class 5 (Voltaire, Lecture 2) due Friday, August 27<br />
      Discuss the following questions after you do the reading assignment (Chapters 14-22). Is Eldorado a genuine utopia or (in one critic's words) &quot;a colossal bore&hellip;satirized by Voltaire as foolish and futile&quot;? Which specific behaviors or institutions show us that Voltaire wants the reader to see Eldorado as utopic? <br />
    Does Voltaire have a philosophical lesson in mind or is it pure satire? Or both? How does it correspond to your personal view of Utopia? Quote from the text with examples to support your answers and include the page reference for each quotation.</p>
<p class="style14">See Lecture Notes on <a href="222dulce.html">Dulce et utile</a>.</p>
<p class="style14">The first original contribution post&mdash;on Pope&mdash;is due Friday at midnight. You will have many authors to choose from to do your required 13 posts (7 original contributions and 6 responses), but I encourage you to get in the habit of posting by starting with Pope or Voltaire. For an original contribution post, make a point or develop an argument of at least 7 lines based on something you read, learned or thought while reading <em>An Essay on Man</em>. Ask a question or make a provocative statement for your classmates to respond to. Did something in your homework get praise or a lot of comment from me? If so, it might be the basis of a good post. </p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style7">Class 6 (Voltaire, Lecture 3)</span> <span class="style13">due Monday, </span><span class="style13">August 30 </span><br />
  Read the page in Supplementary Materials, <a href="Candide%20quotes.html">Quotes from different critics about &quot;Il faut cultiver notre jardin.&quot; </a><br />
  Write a page which includes answers the following questions: what are some  literal and figurative meanings of the word <em>garden</em>? How do they apply to Candide's garden? How do <strong>you</strong> interpret the final line of the story? <br />
  <br />
  To help you to understand the difference between <strong>literal</strong> and <strong>figurative</strong>, here is an example I found online at <a href="http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm">http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm</a> : <br />
<strong>literal</strong> vs. <strong>figurative</strong> meaning - relates to the meanings of words and phrases or expressions. For example, &quot;She was all ears&quot; has a <strong>figurative</strong> meaning (She was listening intently) as well as a <strong>literal</strong> meaning (Her body was composed of ears or she had a huge set of ears). </p>
<p class="style14">Read <em>A Short Guide</em>, Chapter 3. </p>

  <br />
Here are two additional, more modern, sets of critical questions you may choose to address. They were written by a former student, Garry Pigg (Fall, 2005)</p>
<p class="style33">ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM:<span class="style1"><br />
  1. How do the environmental/ecological conditions within the setting of the work affect the language, mood, tone, and theme?<br />
    2. How does the use of the word &quot;nature&quot; in the work reflect the current scientific beliefs of the time and how does that affect the characters, plot, themes?<br />
    3. How does the relationship between man/woman and his/her environment--economically, agriculturally, botanically, socially--affect the characters, language, theme, plot, and tone? i.e. do the characters have to hunt and gather, farm, trade, live in city, country?<br />
    4. How do plants, animals, and their conditions in the environment affect the character's livelihood, the plot, the author's tone, the moods, the theme? i.e. the effects of individual species such as cows, camels, horses, goats, bananas, sugar, cotton, corn, potatoes, fungi, bacteria,<br />
    viruses; and ambient conditions such as drought, flooding, pollution, climate change, introduction of invasive species, and famine.</span></p>
<p class="style1">QUEER THEORY:</p>
<p class="style14">1. How do the cultural feelings about sex affect the characters, plot, and themes?<br />
  2. How does sexual identity affect the characters? How do they deal with others and their own sexual deviance or breaking of social norms?<br />
  3. How does homosexuality or bisexuality play a role in the characters' lives, the tone, mood, theme, and plot of the work?<br />
  4. What role does sexuality play in the work?  How does it affect the use of language? Does it represent love and beauty or marriage and<br />
  reproduction?<br />
  5. How does religion affect the tendencies of the characters to express or not express themselves sexually?<br />
  6. How does the work represent sex and sexuality?  Does it use sexuality to define &quot;others&quot;? Does discussion of sex in the work hinder or help feminism?  Does it hurt or help racism, discrimination in general, and civil rights?  What is the connection between sexuality, race, gender, and social class in the work(s)?</p>

  1) Finish your character sketch to turn in. 2) Choose any one of the following questions about <em>Madame Bovary</em> to answer. Include the question, please, with your answer. These questions would also inspire some good discussions in your Moodle posts.</p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style3"><strong>&bull; FORMALIST CRITICISM:</strong><br />
  - How does Emma's Romantic nature conflict/contribute to the story's 
  Realist nature?<br />
  - How does Flaubert use descriptions and writing style to make the reader feel the same way that the character feels?<br />
  - How does Emma's insatiable desire for passionate affairs relate to her Romantic sensibility?<br />
  - Would the author be successful as a Romantic author?<br />
  - Is the work's major organizing principle Flaubert's goal of &quot;writing a book about nothing&quot;?<br />
  - What does the title of the work reflect about the story?
  <br />
  <br />
</span><br />
<strong>&bull; SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM </strong><br />
&nbsp; <span class="style32"><strong>Marxist Criticism:</strong><br />
- How do Emma's feelings towards her class status affect the decisions she chooses to make throughout the novel? Why do you think Flaubert chooses to portray Emma like this, but allows Charles to be content with their status?<br />
- How does Flaubert portray social class in <em>Madame Bovary </em>and how does it show his own feelings about class?<br />
- If Emma was not satisfied with her social status before she married Charles, when why she did marry a not romantic man that is also not wealthy?<br />
- How does the economy, the amount of money available to characters and their social class affect their lives and mentality?<br />
- If the characters' social classes were switched, how different would the story be?</span><span class="style32"> <br />
  <br />
  </span><br />
  &nbsp; <span class="style91"><strong>Feminist Criticism: </strong><br />
  - What are the
  different roles and duties between men and women in <em>Madame Bovary</em>? eg: Charles, the doctor; Homais, pharmacist; Rouault, farmer. Do women take on any duties or have to work? Does this depend on class structure? eg Wet nurse, F&eacute;licit&eacute;.<br />
  - 
  How are women's desires/dreams different from men's in <em>Madame Bovary</em>?<br />
  - The way that women are portrayed seems to be that they are dreamers and naive? Does that have to do with the time period and the way they seemed back then?<br />
  - Through the creation of Emma's character, is Flaubert trying to hinder feminism by trying to show how the female sex cannot fulfill her role efficiently because she is distracted by passion and material goods?<br />
  - In what ways does Flaubert continuously build a theme of discontent in women throughout 
  <em>Madame Bovary</em>?<br />
  - How
do Emma's romantic ideas influence the plot of the story?  <br />
  - What does this work tell us about the author's view of women during this time?<br />
  - Do Emma Bovary's affairs show the outcome of restrictions in this time period? Is it her way of feeling free?
<br />
  <br />
  </span><br />
  <span class="style92"><strong>&bull; 
  CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM:</strong><br />
  </span><span class="style1">-What significance does the cathedral and the priest trying to show Emma and Leon every last part of it have in the story? What commentary is the author trying to get across by including it?<br />
  - Why does Madame Bovary love the romantic period so much, while this novel was written during the realist period?<br />
  - What role
  does the Industrial Revolution play in the society in which Madame Bovary lives?<br />
  - How does culture affect the feelings/ideas of the characters in the story?<br />
  - How do Emma's relationships with others and 
      reactions to situations reflect the view of Romanticism in the era of Realism?<br />
  - Other than French culture, are there any other cultures that helped Gustave write this story?<br />
  - What kind of unspoken rules/social behaviors lead characters to their actions? For example: Emma's high class behavior etc.

  <strong>&bull; 
  PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </strong><br />
  - Do any of the characters show symptoms of any psychological disorders? If so, why would the author choose this as an explanation for their actions, feelings, and characteristics?<br />
  - Does Emma's inablity to be happy relate to Flaubert's psychological feelings?<br />
  - What does Charles' mother's emotions toward Emma reveal about her psychological state?<br />
  - In <em>Madame Bovary, </em>Emma is portrayed as a discontented character with wildly changing emotions. She could even be described as psychologically unstable. How does Flaubert's writing style change with Emma's psychological state? How do these shifts affect the flow of the novel?<br />
  - What 
is the author's stance, if any, on the manipulation of people and the effect it has on their psychology?  <br />
  - Is Emma actually aware of her actions and the effect that they'll have on people around her? Or are her actions unconscious?
If they are unconscious, if they became conscious, would she change her ways or continue on?  <br />
  - Who has the dominant personality between Charles and Emma? Support your answer with examples from the text.
  <br />
  </span><span class="style94"><br />
  <strong>&bull;
  READER RESPONSE CRITICISM:<br />
  -</strong> How  do Madame Bovary's romantic desires and her situation affect/relate to your own current desires and dreams?<br />
  - After having read <em>Madame Bovary</em>, do you see your own desires and dreams in a different light?<br />
  - How would you describe Emma's feelings toward Berthe and how might this have been different if Berthe had been a boy?<br />
  - In what way(s) did Flaubert write <em>Madame Bovary</em> to connect to the reader's real life experiences?</span><br />
  <span class="style94">- How do you respond to Charles' failure to fix Hippolyte's clubfoot in Book II, Chapter ii, considering what happened to Hippolyte post operation and Madame Bovary's reaction to it all?<br />
  - If you have ever experienced dissatification with life, are you able to feel more connected with Emma? Why or why not?
  </span><br />
  <span class="style95"><br />
  &bull; ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM:<br />
  - How does nature enhance the relationship of the characters in the scene or the mood of the scene?<br />
  - How does the author personify the environmnet to enhance the characters' traits? Espcially with Emma and L&eacute;on? Does the author's tone change? His writing style?
  </span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style97"><strong>&bull; QUEER THEORY: </strong><br />
  - Is Emma's infidelity due to her displeasure with Charles or to her displeasure with her social standing?<br />
  - 
  Do you think that since Emma knows Leon, Charles, and Justin are all in love with her that it is affecting her emotions? Is having too many lovers making her become more depressed/crazy?<br />
  - How do the cultural feelings about sex affect the characters, plots, and themes in   <em>Madame Bovary</em>?<br />
  - How are Emma's feelings about her sexuality expressed through other characters in the work? What does this tell us about the cultural feelings toward sex?</span><span class="style97"><br />

<p class="style14"><strong>EXAMS</strong>: There will be a midterm (15% of final grade) and a final exam (20% of final grade) as indicated on the <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/%7Edsbeckma/222syfa10.html">Syllabus</a>. Make-up for exams will be granted    only if you are excused <strong>in advance</strong> with proper documentation. There may be  a pop-quiz and extra-credit weekly vocabulary quizzes during the semester. <br />
  Exams will consist of:<br />
1) <strong>Identification</strong> of selected passages. Identify the author, work, approximate      date, and original language. Briefly discuss the passage and    its relevance  to the work as a whole with attention to both form and content. <br />
2) <strong>Short essay</strong> (approx. 300 words) on the literary movements  studied. You will be expected to define and illustrated the movement(s)  by referring to authors, works, main ideas, relevant literary terms  (satire, autobiography, absurd) and any appropriate social or historical  events. Include two examples from non-literary cultural artefacts such  as music of the era (heard in class or on your own) or art works from  our textbook or the <a href="http://www.ncartmuseum.org/">North Carolina Museum of Art</a>. <br />
3) <strong>Long essay</strong> (400-500 words) on a given topic or theme and how it is treated in at least    two works we have studied.</p>

</strong></span></span></p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style16"><span class="style83"><strong>  &bull; FORMALIST CRITICISM<br />
  </strong>-How does the translation from German to English affect the overall form and meaning of the story?<br />
  -How does the use of a nonhuman main character reinforce the idea of defamiliarization?<br />
  - How do various elements of the work create and reinforce its meanings?
  <br />
</span><span class="style31"><span class="style32"><br />
  <span class="style4">&bull; </span></span></span><span class="style4"><strong>SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM</strong></span><span class="style33"><br />
  <strong>Marxist Criticism</strong><br />
  - How does Gregor's as well as the rest of the family's attitude toward his metamorphosis reveal the work's view of social matters?<br />
  -
  What can you determine of Gregory's economic /social status? How does this affect the story? His family?<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  </span><span class="style92">Feminist Criticism<br />
  </span></span><span class="style87">- What is the role that women play in Gregory's life?<br />
  - How are the roles and reactions of the women typical of this time?</span><span class="style16"><span class="style92"><br />
  </span></span><span class="style87">- What is the role of women in <em>The Metamorphosis</em>?<br />
  - How does
  living in a patriarchal society affect the women in the story? How do you know it is a patriarchal society?<br />
  - Based on the first
  half of the story, Greogor (man) seems to provide all the money for the family while the women (Grete and his mother) do not even work. Does this idea of lifestyle describe this period of time or even the author's belief of how women should behave?<br />
  <br />
  </span><span class="style16"><span class="style32"><strong><br />
  </strong></span><span class="style121">&bull; 
    CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM</span><span class="style49"><br />
    -
    What event in history does this metamorphosis remind you of?<br />
    - What is the reason behind the author's pessimistic view of authority?<br />
    - <em>The Metamophosis</em>, published in 1915, is an expressionistic work. Expressionism was a writing and thought style in Germany from 1910-1925. How does the story exhibit Expressionist traits?<br />
- In this time period, men are still responsible for taking care of the household finances and thinking rationally, while the women take care of the home and family. How are these stereotypical roles represented and also misrepresented?<br />
- How does culture affect the psychology of Gregory and his family?<br />
- What doe Gregor, the insect, signifiy culturally or hsitorically in the first two sections of the story?
    <br />
  </span><span class="style32"><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style93">&bull; 
    PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM<br />
  </span></span></span><span class="style931">- Could the way that Gregor's parents do not understand him have to do with the way Franz Kafka feels in life as if nobody listens?<br />
  -
  Why does Kafka choose to turn Gregor into a unknown insect and why is he the only one who cares for other people?</span><span class="style16"><span class="style32"><br />
  </span></span><span class="style931">- Each character reacts to Gregory's metamorphosis in a different way. What do these reactions tell us about the psyche of each individual?<br />
  - How do Gregory's actions depict his personality?<br />
  - How do Gregory's physical change and his reactions to it reflect his psychological state?<br />
  - How does Gregory seeing himself as a bug reveal his personality and psychological state?<br />
  - Gregory does not freak out when he wakes up as a bug like normal people would. What does this say about Gregory psychologically?<br />
  - How does Gregory's father's reaction to Gregory's metamorphosis reflect on the father's psychological state?
  <br />
  <br />
  </span><span class="style16"><span class="style32"><br />
  <span class="style116">&bull;
  READER RESPONSE CRITICISM</span></span><span class="style116"><br />
  </span></span><span class="style1161">- How do you respond to the family's treatment of Gregor? Consider both Gregory's condition as an insect and feelings.<br />
  - Why is there no reason given for his transformation?<br />
  - Kafka's choice of an insect can be interpreted in many different ways. Why do you think Kakfa chose an insect for the Gregory character?<br />
  - How do you respond to the way the author intorduces Gregory Samsa to the readers?<br />
  - Has
  there ever been a time (thinking back) that you could relate to the feeling of Gregor as he awoke or even as he lived after the change? If not, could you relate it to a real life scenario, something that could have happened to you?<br />
  -Do you think Gregor's family reacted the way you would expect your family to react, if you awoke as a giant bug?<br />
  Why does the author choose not to go into more detail when he describes the mian character waking up in a new body?
  <br />
  </span><span class="style16"><span class="style116"><br />
  </span><span class="style117"><br />
  &bull; ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM</span></span><span class="style95"><span class="style1171"><br />
  - What is the importance of the alarm clock?<br />
  - How does being in his home affect how drastic the memamorphosis is to his family?<br />
  </span></span><span class="style1171">- How does the author use language and people's reactions to promote the image of Gregory as a bug?</span><span class="style16"><span class="style117"><br />
  </span><span class="style32"><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style118">&bull;
QUEER THEORY<br />
  </span></span></span><span class="style1181">- How did Gregory's family change before and after his &quot;insect&quot; transformation? <br />
  - How does Gregor's sudden transformation change the interaction he has with the other characters? Do you think this has any similarities to the interaction with others that a homosexual receives after &quot;coming out of the closet&quot;?<br />
- How is this story a depiction of homophobia and prejuidice in 1910's Germany? <br />
-What is the human mind capable of? What is the human heart able to withstand? </span><span class="style16"><span class="style32"><span class="style118"><br />

Now answer your own question, or another student's (see above), based on the <strong>whole</strong> story. How might we interpret the <em>Metamorphosis</em> through the lens of Formalist, Marxist, Feminist&hellip; criticism?

<p class="style141"><strong>Choose your topic<br />
  </strong>Read through the topic choices below. Consult Chapter 10 in <em>A Short Guide</em>, <em>Writing about Fiction: the World of the Story</em>, especially the <em>Getting Ideas </em>pages (171-5).  Which texts have been your favorite or challenged you the most? Send me an email or make an appointment if you need help deciding on a topic. <br />
  <br />
  <b>Steps for writing </b><br />
  - Step 1: read, re-read and annotate your texts; write preliminary notes; build up to a fully formulated thesis. A thesis is a clear and specific argument, not a list, not an opinion, not an obvious fact.</p>
<p class="style141">See the <a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/course/FL/222">Library Tools</a> page to see resources available to you from NCSU libraries. </p>
<p class="style141">- Step 2: Following <em>A Short Guide</em>, Chapter 3; write a first draft of 1-2 pages about one of the topics below for the peer review session. It should have a working title and a fully formulated introduction (you can rewrite them later, but they need to be there for the draft) and several finished paragraphs; your audience knows the text, so you should avoid plot summaries. Use the present tense for literary analysis: Ivan <strong>is</strong> an ambitious&hellip; Flaubert <strong>reveals</strong>&hellip; Include your outline. This is the peer review draft version of your paper; print and bring 2 copies of it to class. Include the <a href="PeerReviewFeedback.html">Peer Review Feedback form</a> with each copy.<span class="style43"><br />

<p class="style141">Dr. Beckman's hint about titles: A dull title sets expectations low. A good title invites the reader! Quotes, proverbs or aphorisms make great titles. Try a google search with a key word from your thesis (pride, satisfaction, quest, etc) and the word quote. I've already got a <a href="222Lovequotes.html">web page</a> with love quotes for you to use, since love is such a popular topic. </p>

<p class="style1">-Step 3: Reflect on your peer reviewers' suggestions and write a full draft of your paper to turn in to me. Proofread following the <em>Editing</em> and other checklists listed on the inside cover of <em>A Short Guide</em>. I will not grade the paper at this point but will return it to you with comments, so that you can write the final draft. Consult the <a href="222scoringrubric.html">Scoring Rubric for Papers</a> and <a href="222scoringrubric-rewrite.html">Scoring Rubric for Creative Papers</a> so that you'll know what I will be looking for when I do grade the paper. This web page  from the NCSU Writing and Speaking Tutorial site also offers guidelines to help you revise and edit your draft: <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/tutorial_center/writespeak/Revising.htm">http://www.ncsu.edu/tutorial_center/writespeak/Revising.htm</a></p>
<p class="style1">Chapter 14 in <em>A Short Guide</em> is an exellent presentation of the style and format I expect in  a literary paper. Pay attention to good organization and logical transitions between paragraphs. 
  Base your arguments on close readings. Two areas that are normally weak in the first draft are the use of quotations and the conclusion.   Give concrete examples (quotes) from 
  the texts to support your arguments, but not to fill up space.  For quotations from the text, keep in mind that they are the evidence you need to provide to prove your point. You will usually use at least one in each of body paragraphs. In order to integrate quotes appropriately, be sure to introduce the quote by making the point the quote illustrates, include the quote (usually 3-5 lines of text), and then tie the quote back into your argument with a concluding sentence: &quot;&hellip;remind your reader that these passages are there to prove a point. End your discussion on your words, not theirs.&quot; (Shannon, 162-3).</p>
<p class="style1">A conclusion is very important to a fully developed paper. Have you've answered a key question in the conclusion to your paper: &quot;So what?&quot; I will be asking the same question when I read your paper. <br />
  <br />
  You are not required to use secondary sources (books, articles, internet) for this paper, but if you do, be sure to quote and document them properly and attach a &#147;Works Cited&#148; page. <strong>Plagiarism is a poor choice and will not be tolerated</strong>; consult the <a href="222CIfa10.html">Course Information</a> page about the NC State academic integrity policy; ask me if questions remain. For information on using research (if you do) and writing the documentation page, consult <em>A</em> <em>Short Guide</em>, chapter 15. </p>

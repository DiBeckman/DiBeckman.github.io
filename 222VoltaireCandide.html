<div align="center" class="style1">Stories based on Voltaire's <em>Candide 
</em></div>
<p> <span class="style1">Chapter 27.5 </span>by Jordan Parsons</p>
<p>Around that time, while the philosopher was explaining to his student how everything was in fact for the best, Candide saw that to the East there came into view, only a reasonably short distance away, a most hospitable looking little island.<br />
  --Would it not be for the best,&quot; questioned Candide, &quot;if we were to anchor at that small spit of land?  I've no more urgent quest than to be reunited with my dearest Cun&eacute;gonde, but I don't think it wise to sail through the night.  We've had hard enough times at sea, in circumstance beyond control, to test ourselves against the dark.<br />
  --Quite so, agreed Pangloss, in fact we'd be very foolish to not do the very thing, as it is obvious that the island these is there expressly for the purpose of being stopped at in route to Propontis by way of sea, with the intent of being reunited with Cun&eacute;gonde.<br />
  Pangloss congratulated Candide on his very logical course of reasoning, and lectured to the others on mirroring such mentalities.<br />
  The Captain, having finished his dinner of the finest gruel, fit only for the finest or captions of the finest of galleys, had just come on deck in time to overhear Candide's most reasonable proposal, and agreed wholeheartedly.<br />
  --Good Captain, asked Pangloss, still caught up in his sermon, you too can see te express purpose of this island, yes?<br />
  --Certainly!  It is none other than the isle of Zisbon, and since you bunch who paid a most reasonable fare don't seem to mind the excursion, I will gladly take the time to trade with the indigenous population in a most favorable way, and I would certainly say that that is the purpose of that place.<br />
  While Pangloss paused to ponder the seeming duality of purpose of that not-so-insignificant island, the good Captain proceeded to direct a young crewman to correct the course of the galley to make way for Zisbon.  The rest merely watched, anticipating a most opportune leg-stretching and walking-about, the kind one can only perform on solid ground.  Truth be told, the very first thing Candide saw as the vessel came to rest at dock was none other than the Anabaptist, Jacques.<br />
  --What an amazing thing! cried Candide.  Can it be that he who took me in and nursed dearest Pangloss in his sickness is in fact here and not under the sea?  How can this be?<br />
  Having heard tale of the Anabaptist from Candide's stories, the rest of the friends expressed a similar desire to know the answer to his question, and thus hurried from the boat to the dock and went directly to Jacques.<br />
  --Faithful friend!  exclaimed Candide.<br />
  --Kind Benefactor!  cried Pangloss.<br />
  --Why, what a strange thing, replied Jacques, that I should meet with you my fellows once again after so long.  I had thought surely that the sea had taken you on that most dreadful of days!<br />
  --We had assumed the same fate for you, my friend, replied Candide.  How is it that you escaped such a grisly demise?<br />
  --I will tell you, but first you must introduce me to your friends.  It seems you have assembled quite the party since last I set eyes on you.<br />
  Candide and Pangloss then together introduced everyone to everyone, and all the finest formalities were executed flawlessly.  After that, the group departed the docks in search of a meal and a place conducive to the telling of one's story.  Having found such a place at a little ways from the dock in a small diner, the Anabaptist shared his story.<br />
  --You see, my friends, it is true that I was pulled bodily under the waves on that fateful day.  I had though surely that I would drown and cease to exist, along with everyone else who had been aboard.  As the wild currents pulled me along, there was nothing for it but to hold my breath and hope for the best.  I'm not sure the best is what occurred, bur if not, and then surely what happened was second-best.  Just as I was ready to expire, a wild torrent of water shot me above the surface of the sea, and I was in fact lucky enough to land in due course on a small raft that had been dislodged from the vessel in which we were sailing.  Too weak from my exertions to do more than lie there and teach myself again to breath air, I simply floated, letting the wind take me where it would.<br />
  --Luck I'm sure, had nothing to do with it, said Pangloss, as if it had not been the intent purpose of that raft to be under your fall, would you not have in fact perished?<br />
  --Without that boat, I'm sure of it, although I still think it quite a lucky thing.  In any case let me continue.<br />
  So he continued the tale of his fate:  --Where the wind would take me happened to be the city of Sines, and the sight of Pedro's castle upon the cliffs roused me from my weakened state and spawned in me a feeling of wonder (note:  Dr. Beckman I don't know how to add foot notes to just one page and I really want to here!).  After making way as best I could to shore, I took some time in a nearby inn to recover, and after that I proceeded with due haste to make my way back to Lisbon, which was in a terrible state.  As all the business I had there was effectively ruined, and I had believed my good friends deceased, I was in sorry shape.  Nonetheless I made my steady way back home.  There I found that civil unrest was making things quite unpleasant, so I gathered what possessions I had in went out in search of a hospitable place.  A series of entirely normal and unexciting circumstances then found me here on this delightful little island.<br />
  --You're too modest, remarked Martin, surely you faced some great trials along the way.<br />
  --What?  Being tossed about in a raging see wasn't enough?  I tell you my life was fairly boring after that, when held in comparison.  But here, my throat is dry and I should very much like to hear what became of my supposedly drowned friends.<br />
  So Candide and company took their turns telling their tales, the telling of which went well into the night, after which the Anabaptist brought them all to his modest little house.  After a restful night's sleep for a change, the troupe gathered at the dock, just before the Captain.<br />
  --Won't you come with us, Jacques?  questioned Candide.<br />
  --I'm afraid not, my friends, replied the Anabaptist, as I am not well accepted in many places and quite enjoy my life here on this small island.<br />
  After a heartening round of goodbyes, handshakes, hugs, kisses, and promises of future visits, the friends, minus the Anabaptist, returned to the deck, and the captain shoved off once again for Propontis.<br />

<p><span class="style1">2) Did They Really Live Happily Ever After?</span><br />
by Andrew Louden </p>
<p> That is very well put, said Candide, but we must cultivate our garden&hellip;.<br />
  Everything goes very well at the beginning of the group&rsquo;s farming experience.  The fruit is juicy and sweet and the vegetables, ripe and colorful.  As winter approaches, the group takes the necessary precautions to make sure they can last until they can plant the next spring.  They take some of their produces into town to make some money, so that they can buy the necessities a garden will not provide. <br />
  Throughout the winter, everyone is bored.  Candide can take no more of Cunegonde&rsquo;s ugliness and desiring the warmth and touch of Paquette.  They pass time sneaking around their house, but with so many people in such a small house, word starts getting passed about Candide and Paquette&rsquo;s new hobby.  So one night after a nice physics experiment, they fall asleep together instead of returning to their own room. <br />
  In the morning when Candide wakes up, he looks over and sees Paquette&rsquo;s lifeless body with a large kitchen knife sticking in it.  Candide realizing what has happened, quietly disposes of the body and goes back to Cunegonde to beg forgiveness.  Everyone else realizes what has taken place, so they gladly keep quiet and are relieved now that there is one less mouth to feed.<br />
  -	It is all for the best, Pangloss points out, she was the worst farmer in the group and the largest appetite of us all.<br />
  -	Why of course you are right again, Candide admits, but now that winter is over let us cultivate our garden.<br />
  -	I agree said Cunegonde<br />
  -	I don&rsquo;t really know if you are correct, Martin interrupts.<br />
  Soon, winter ended to everyone&rsquo;s relief, and it was time for the farm to start up again.  As they had the year before, everyone went out and planted the wide variety of plants they had collected from their wide variety of travels through Europe and Asia.  They took all necessary precautions and preparations and in no time they were done.  The only thing left was to wait for rain and harvest their crops.  After one week, it had not rained.  After a month, it still had not rained.  The whole group started to worry because rain is a necessity for farmers and you can almost guarantee rain during the spring rainy season.  After three months, there still was no rain and they were forced to reason that their farming had failed.  It was time for them to set off and find another means of survival.  This was not the first time that the worst possible thing had happened and they were forced to abandon the comfort of home.<br />
  -	Pangloss announced, it is probably better now because my back was sore from all the bending over last year.<br />
  -	Candide muttered, yes you are probably right, and my nails got dirty last year too.<br />
  -	Martin looked at them both as if they had lost their reasoning and said, we are broke, we have no food, and we have no hope.<br />
  After a lot of bickering, the clan decided to make their way west to the beggar&rsquo;s realm.  They only got half way down the dirt path leading from their home before they all fell into a huge sinkhole.  While they were discussing strategies on how to get out, they looked up and Paquette was standing at the top of the hole.  This was the moment they realized it was not a sinkhole but a simple trap. <br />
  -	Paquette laughed and said; now I will have my revenge on you.<br />
  She then started throwing rocks and dirt in on them and burying them alive. <br />
  -	I have been digging this trap for weeks now.  I am glad it paid off.   Paquette announced.<br />
  Pangloss looks at the group and then looks at Candide and starts to cry.<br />
  -	 He moans and then after a few moments says, I could say this happened for the best of things right now, but if I did I would be lying. <br />
  -	You are finally starting to sound logical, admitted Martin<br />
  For the first time in his life, Pangloss realized his whole life was a failure and he had not only been lying to himself but to all of his friends.  Everyone in the group begged to Paquette to let them free so they could figure out what the best course of action was for survival.  Paquette ignored him.  Candide then told Paquette of a place he had visited once.  He told her of a place where you could acquire all the riches in the world.  This seemed to catch Paquette&rsquo;s ear because she immediately stopped burying them. <br />
  -	Paquette somewhat interested, questioned the group saying, How do I know you guys are not lying and will not kill me if I let you out?<br />
  -	They all told her that she had their word.<br />
  After much thought, Paquette gave in and let them all out.  They of course were all too grateful to have gotten out of the situation to think about killing Paquette.  After regaining poseur, they started out again from their house, of course this time in a totally new direction.  They were now on a direction of hope and promise.  For they all knew that if they could make it to Eldorado, they would live a life of happiness and peace.</p>

<p><span class="style1">3) Candide Continued </span><br />
  by Brett Goodman <br />
  <br />
  - &ldquo;That is very well put, said Candide, but we must cultivate our garden&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
Candide had given careful thought to the Turk&rsquo;s advice, and was striving to embrace his new life, so he might elude life&rsquo;s three great evils.  As the months passed, each one in the group took to their duties with the utmost enthusiasm and each became more proficient.  Candide and Martin soon yielded a fine crop.  Cunegonde, although hideous, made the most delicious pastries in the land.  Paquette&rsquo;s embroidery was breathtaking, and the old woman&rsquo;s laundry was spotless. <br />
Pangloss, busy contemplating causes and effect while Candide and Martin worked the fields, would often remark:- Look at this fine life we have.  You are certainly the best farmer in the land.  Cunegonde&rsquo;s skill in the kitchen is unmatched.  I am constantly more amazed by Paquette&rsquo;s embroidery, and my clothes reappear as though they were new each day.  Certainly this is the best of all possible worlds.<br />
- We do appear to have all of life&rsquo;s necessities, replied Candide.<br />
- Ah ha, it is proved, said Pangloss<br />
Candide had long since recognized the futility of questioning Plangloss&rsquo;s philosophical ramblings, and returned to his work.  Although in the back of his mind the question lingered, was this really the best of all possible worlds?  As Candide drifted off into thought, he began to ponder what he might be doing at that very moment if he had remained in Eldorado or what great plays were showing in Paris.  He found these thoughts to be discouraging, and continued his work, trying to put them out of his mind.<br />
Later on, once Pangloss had wandered off to continue his search for philosophical truth, Martin would quickly retort in his customary dejected manner:- It is easy for Pangloss to make assertions as to the excellence of our lives; he is not the one tilling the fields and harvesting the crops.  Perhaps his opinion would change after a hard day&rsquo;s work.  However, I don&rsquo;t believe that day will ever come because men seldom change.<br />
- Don&rsquo;t mind him, Candide replied, trying to ease his frustration.  The problem with people who spend all their time in deep thought is that, as a result, they lack the everyday experiences on which to base their thoughts.<br />
For the moment this calmed Martin&rsquo;s irritation, but Candide knew that his conjecture had merit and the philosopher&rsquo;s comments fueled the growing dissatisfaction Candide felt towards his new life as a farmer. <br />
As the group&rsquo;s unofficial leader, Candide struggled to put off these feelings for the betterment of the group.  Everyone was performing splendidly on the farm, and the last thing he wanted was to disrupt their peaceful lives with his malcontent.  After the intense adversity they had all endured, their present situation was remarkably improved.  Not one of them wanted for any of life&rsquo;s necessities; there was always food on the table and a place to lay their heads at night.  Life as a farmer had indeed kept Candide from poverty and vice, and yet, he had to admit, he was bored.<br />
His previous life, albeit full of hardship and danger, had provided constant excitement and adventure.  He would often sit on his porch at the end of the long day&rsquo;s work and think to himself:- I once traveled the world, braved the jungles of the Americas, and even walked the streets of Eldorado.  The years of his metaphysical training would leave him wondering:- What causes led to my present state? <br />
Candide, having long recognized the link between causes and effects, questioned what actions might have resulted in a more desirable outcome, and furthermore, could his fate still be changed.<br />
After much contemplation, Candide concluded that this simply was not the ideal life for him, and he knew what he had to.  The following morning, as everyone awoke to begin their daily routine, Candide was nowhere to be found.  They discovered a letter on the kitchen table which read:- This is not the life I envisioned when I set out from Westphalia.  I have left to cultivate my own garden.  Farewell.</p>
<p><span class="style1">4. CHAPTER 31 by Brain-Anthony Garrison<br />
How the Old Woman Came to Die </span>(Final Draft)<br />
A pleasant and quite productive fortnight passed after Candide and the group went to work cultivating their garden, before the old woman suddenly grew ill of unknown and natural causes. She became bedridden, unable to muster up the strength to venture out of her room. Cun&eacute;gonde and Paquette would come to her room everyday and feed her at her bedside, and Candide would occasionally walk by her room to check on her out of polite concern. The old woman always caught Candide as he poked his head through her doorway, and she weakly smiled at him. The two of them would chat briefly before Candide thought it was best to leave her to her rest. Even in her ailing condition, the old woman always found something to talk about, but now more than anything else, she spoke of how bored she was. <br />
Candide sat out on the front porch one afternoon with Martin and Cacambo as the sun began to set. They were silently brooding over the old woman's condition, save Martin who had already accepted her fate. Candide broke the silence: - Oh my friends, what ails our dear friend, the old woman so? <br />
- It is death, answered Martin. Her poor, wretched body has endured infinite abuse over the long span of her life and is now on the verge of finally giving out. <br />
- It must be so, added Cacambo. Her life was long and full of suffering at every other turn, even more than the rest of us. It's a miracle that she's lived as long as she has. <br />
Those words rang true to Candide, though he dared not agree with them and admit to the old woman's fate. They all fell silent once more for a moment until Candide spoke up worriedly: - Must it really be so? Pangloss, the Baron, and my dear Cun&eacute;gonde have all survived worse deaths. Why should our old woman just suddenly come to die in such a manner? He turned his head to Martin and back to Cacambo, who both looked down in response to his glance. Neither of them had an answer that could put him at peace. Candide looked down in contemplation for a moment and then turned back towards the house to look for Pangloss, but Paquette met him right outside the doorway and summoned the trio back inside. <br />
The entire group had gathered in the old woman's room, where she lay motionless in her bed with her eyes closed and her face without color. Cun&eacute;gonde was stretched across her body, sobbing heavily into her sheets. There was no denying it now; the old woman had passed away. <br />
Later that same afternoon, the group buried her in the backyard in the center of a large flowerbed. The sun had set, setting the sky ablaze with a fiery orange glow. Candide, Martin, and Cacambo, toiled away at digging a hole in the ground with three spades. Pangloss and Brother Girofl&eacute;e constructed a thin wooden platform on which they laid the old woman. Paquette and Cun&eacute;gonde adorned her with several flowers and covered her up to her neck in a sheet that Paquette had embroidered, in the hope that she would pass into the next world with beautiful elegance. The group wove ropes under the platform and slowly and carefully lowered her down into her grave; not a single detail was out of place. The entire group bade farewell to the old woman, and the gravediggers refilled the hole they had dug in their flowerbed.<br />
Cun&eacute;gonde had returned to the house while the three gravediggers were still patting down the dirt of the grave. By the time they had finished, she came back with a small wooden cross in her hands, which she placed into the ground as a grave marker. The group silently stood around the newly formed resting place of the old woman; no one could think of anything proper to say. Cun&eacute;gonde tearfully embraced her husband, crying into his chest; Candide wrapped his arms around her in consolation. <br />
Night had fallen. The group had gone to bed, save Candide, Martin, and Pangloss who sat awake in contemplation of the day's events. With his head low, Candide spoke in a sad voice: &ndash; To think that our dear old woman should die so suddenly.<br />
- I believe it is for the best, Pangloss said. At least now she is finally free from her mortal suffering. <br />
Candide looked at him blankly for a moment before replying &ndash; Perhaps you're right. <br />
- Either way, it was inevitable, said Martin. We are all bound to die one day, one way or another. <br />
At this, the three of them fell silent for a moment. All was quiet. Then Martin rose to his feet with a sigh &ndash; Well then, I suppose I could do the laundry from now on. </p>

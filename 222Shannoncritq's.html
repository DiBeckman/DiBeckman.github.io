<p>From Edward Shannon's<span class="text"> The Prentice Hall Guide to Writing about Literature</span> (Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2002).</p>
<p>Four very basic questions to ask about a literary work (p. 27):</p>
What is confusing?<br />
What is repeated?<br />
What is familiar?<br />
What is strange? 
<p>Next, here is Shannon's list of critical questions related to different literary theories (pages 61-4, plus the final two written by my former student, Garry Pigg). You will want to adapt these questions for any individual text that you are studying. </p>
<p align="center" class="style3">Questions to consider in <strong>Formalist </strong>Criticism</p>
<p class="style3">1. How do various elements of the work (plot, character, point of view) create and reinforce its meanings?<br />
  2. How are the elements
  related to the whole?<br />
  3. What is the work&rsquo;s major organizing principle?<br />
  4. What issues are raised by the work? How does the work&rsquo;s structure resolve those issues?<br />
  <br />

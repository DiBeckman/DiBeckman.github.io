  The Last Days of His Father&rsquo;s Life</span><span class="style7"><br>
by Amber Howard</span> </p>
<p class="style9">My father is getting even worse. It&rsquo;s past midnight and I still haven&rsquo;t been able to fall asleep. His screams are heart wrenching and wake me up in the middle of the night. I wish I could do something to help him or even just go in and see him but I know that that would be inappropriate. My family is not really the affectionate type, and I do not think my father would welcome me in his room. But why? He&rsquo;s my father, can&rsquo;t I show him that I love him. My father is going to be dead soon and he will have never known me. I will never get to know the real Ivan Ilyich. I know he loved his job but I wish that sometimes he would have showed us, his family, that we were important to him also. I wish that he and mom wouldn&rsquo;t have fought so much. She doesn&rsquo;t even seem concerned that he is suffering still. And my father is spending all his time with the servant, why does he not want to spend time with me? I&rsquo;m his son! I&rsquo;ve done everything I thought he wanted me to do. I go to school each day and do my best. I make great grades and always look presentable just in case I run into someone my father knows, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to embarrass him. Well, I think dad has finally fallen asleep, I guess I&rsquo;ll try to get some rest also.</p>
<p class="style9">Man, this lack of sleep is killing me. I&rsquo;m getting so far behind in my school work. All I think about is that my father is dying and I never had a relationship with him. I wonder if he knows that I love him. I feel like he has always just looked right past me. But why should he have looked at me? I haven&rsquo;t done anything to be proud of, I&rsquo;m just like all the normal kids, nothing outstanding. Each day I just go to school, get my work done, make acceptable grades, but I definitely do not stand out. Maybe if I had done something great, he would have noticed me and been proud. </p>
<p class="style9">My teacher asked me again today if everything was alright with me. She said that there were dark circles under my eyes and that I was disconnected and distracted. I told her everything was ok, I do not want to embarrass my father. I know how concerned he is with how people view him. Time for dinner, hopefully it&rsquo;ll be less eventful than last night. I don&rsquo;t know why my sister and mother have to be so inconsiderate and mean to him. He&rsquo;s sick. It&rsquo;s not like he can help it. I&rsquo;m sure he would not choose to have what it is that he has. That makes me even sadder to see them disrespect him. But, here we go.</p>
<p class="style9">It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve written. It&rsquo;s been the same stuff, Dad in pain and everyone apparently annoyed at the inconvenience. Dad has really gotten closer to Gerasim. Seems like the only time Dad is able to sleep is when Gerasim is near, I wish that could be me. Tonight my sister got engaged. Dad wasn&rsquo;t even involved in the celebration. He is starting to get worse, which in turn means that Lisa and mom are even more perturbed. Lisa is only thinking about herself and how dad&rsquo;s illness is ruining her limelight. But she&rsquo;s always been in the spotlight. I somehow am always in the shadows. I always keep my mouth shut, I just live the life everyone wants me live. I don&rsquo;t create any chaos or ruckus, I go about my own business quietly. Should I stand up for what I believe in even if other people do not agree? Should I let my father know how much I care for him and how much I am going to miss him? Should I let him see how devastated I am that he is in pain? I&rsquo;m sick of how mom and Lisa are so selfish. It really bothers me that they cannot get past their own feelings. I think I&rsquo;ll go visit Dad right now, hopefully he&rsquo;s awake. </p>
<p class="style9">I went in to see Dad last night but he was quietly sleeping, something that is a rare occurrence. I cried myself to sleep last night. This morning was horrible. I woke up to Dad&rsquo;s horrifying screams of pain. He hasn&rsquo;t been able to stop all morning. Even when I came home from school he was still in pain. It&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s in a whole different world. I wonder if he even realizes when I stand in the doorway and just watch him. My heart goes out to him. I wish he only knew that I am not selfish like Lisa and mom. I genuinely pity him. </p>
<p class="style9">It&rsquo;s been 2 days since the last time I&rsquo;ve written. Dad has not gotten any better, in fact it&rsquo;s gotten worse. He&rsquo;s in such agonizing pain. I cannot do anything to help him, and I don&rsquo;t think he even realizes that I wish I could do something to comfort him. </p>
<p class="style9">He&rsquo;s dead. I&rsquo;m numb. I couldn&rsquo;t help him. I wonder if he even felt me kiss his hand. He touched me. He put his hand on my head. He did love me. I know he did. I didn&rsquo;t want to let go of his hand, he meant so much to me. Perhaps because I feel like I am so much like him. I don&rsquo;t want to live the way he did. I don&rsquo;t think he was ever truly happy. What can I do to be truly happy? Can I ever be happy? Have I ever been happy? What can I learn from my father&rsquo;s life? It&rsquo;s too much right now. Life is too much right now. My heart is broken. My heart is furious. I&rsquo;m just &hellip;. Numb. I miss him already. I miss you Dad. I hope you know I loved you.</p>
<p class="style9">Dear Diary:</p>
<p class="style9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve made so many changes in my life since the last time I&rsquo;ve written. I was afraid to even pick up this dark memory of my life. My father&rsquo;s death was such a tragedy. It affected every part of my life. During my father&rsquo;s illness my eyes were opened to the way my family had always operated. My role in the family was to be in the shadows, my sister&rsquo;s role was to marry someone respectable, my mother&rsquo;s was to live a life of luxury, while my father was to be the middle class breadwinner. I have a feeling that he did not really enjoy his life. It was too simple, too ordinary, and thus must have been terrible. I have decided I will not be the simple, ordinary young man I once was. </p>
<p class="style9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have discovered passions that I never knew I had. I am working with doctors to learn about new diseases and find possible cures. Also, I take interest in the patients that the doctors are seeing. I tell them stories to help them smile. It&rsquo;s amazing what a little genuine care and compassion can do to minimize pain. Doing this work helped me realize why my father was attached to Gerasim during the final days of his life. Gerasim was genuine. I thank Gerasim from the bottom of my heart for helping comfort my father when no one else could. Now, I am a &ldquo;Gerasim.&rdquo; I help people cope with their illness even when the illness is due to unknown causes.</p>
<p class="style8"><span class="style7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think about my father everyday. He really changed my life. I will always care about him and I think he is looking down on me and very proud of whom I&rsquo;ve become.</span><br>

  2) <em>The Inner Thoughts of Gerasim</em><br>
by Ashley Muma </p>
<p>I had to look after Mr. Ilyich today. Some people may consider my duties a filthy task but it doesn&rsquo;t bother me. I usually have to clean up after his excretions and help him up once he&rsquo;s finished. He&rsquo;s extremely weak from his sickness and seems to have a bit of trouble functioning normally. Seems to me he just needs a little company to help him through the days until he passes on. I can&rsquo;t quite make sense of his sickness but I know it&rsquo;s making him tired and distraught. I can&rsquo;t imagine feeling the way he must feel. I thank God everyday for my health. My father always taught me to take care of others in need for I&rsquo;ll be in their position one day. For this reason, I put forth as much effort as possible with Mr. Ilyich. My father would be proud. I also enjoy the conversation. He&rsquo;s got some interesting things to say although he talks about himself a lot and his work even more. I had always understood Mr. Ilyich to be self absorbed and engulfed in his work. This is usually the main complaint from the servants around the house. Yet, I find when one knows him deeper he truly does have other cares and interesting observations on life. I wonder if being idle so much has led him to new realizations. I&rsquo;m sure he is not enjoying his sickness and finds himself quite bored compared to how occupied he kept himself with his work prior to this sickness. </p>
<p>Mr. Ilyich must be disappointed with his family. They pay him no mind. It&rsquo;s as if this illness was almost welcomed. By this I mean, it seems he was such an encumbrance to them that his absence could in fact be some sort of relief. I know his sickness is tiring for the family yet they seemed to have no stamina for him even when he was well. It leads me to wonder if he truly was a burden while alive. I can imagine Mr. Ilyich must have been a bit difficult to get along with at times. I never noticed many fights between Mr. Ilyich and his wife but then again to think of it I never noticed much conversation at all between the two of them. Perhaps they bored one another. I could not begin to explain their relationship as I haven&rsquo;t been around for enough of it. All I see now is a look of dismay in the family&rsquo;s eyes and an air of impatience. There seems to be little concern or grief. His wife checks in on him from time to time. She looks as him as though he&rsquo;s nothing but a bother. I&rsquo;m wondering if she&rsquo;ll actually mourn when he&rsquo;s gone. </p>
<p>In my observations during my time at the Ilyich house, it has appeared to me he could have been absent during his children&rsquo;s youth and neglectful of his marriage given his focus on his job. At least he&rsquo;s good at what he does. Such a concentration paid off. He&rsquo;s a damn good lawyer. A good man, I&rsquo;d say. He sings my praises for taking care of him but I see no need for it. I&rsquo;m just acting as a good man should. To be honest I&rsquo;m grateful he needs me. It gives me a different sense of usefulness and worth. He gives me a break from chopping wood which I really have to get back to now. All I can say is I like Mr. Ilyich. It&rsquo;ll be a shame to see him go. I only hope to bring him company and some piece of mind during his time left on this earth. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gerasim closed his journal and stood up. He brushed the dirt off his pants and picked up his axe. Gerasim whistled to himself a bit as he continued splitting wood. A small smile spread across his face as need beckoned to him again. He set down his axe and answered Ivan Ilyich&rsquo;s calls. He went into the house and found Mr. Ilyich inside. Gerasim looked at Ivan Ilyich and felt a new emotion: thankfulness. He realized that their relationship was a simple exchange. That more than just taking care of Mr. Ilyich, Mr. Ilyich took care of him. While Ivan needed Gerasim for comfort and company, Gerasim needed Ivan to provide him with a new sense of self.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His relationship with Mr. Ilyich had caused him to remember many fond memories of his childhood. He recalled the day that his grandparents had moved in with his family. He had been excited as a child not realizing the seriousness of his grandfather&rsquo;s condition. Gerasim had been too focused on the joys of having all his family under one roof. It didn&rsquo;t take long for him to understand the situation and why his grandparents had come. His grandmother had always been arthritic and needed help to function but his grandfather had always taken care of her. Now he had tuberculosis and couldn&rsquo;t tend to her as she needed. His father had offered for them to move in and realizing the necessity of it, they accepted. Gerasim remembered his parents never grudged them for all the work and extra means they required of them. His father would always say that aside from needing to be hospitable to everyone in general, parents were even more important. Parents clothe and take care of their children so that one day their children will clothe and take care of them. </p>
<p>It was this idea, this kind heartedness that gave Gerasim such patience dealing with Mr. Ilyich. Gerasim&rsquo;s father had lived a long and respectful life and had died recently also of tuberculosis. While Gerasim tended to his father in his last days he saw many gruesome things as his condition deteriorated. He was never disgusted with Ivan Ilyich for he had seen worse with his father&rsquo;s bloody death. Now only Gerasim and his mother remained. His mother was still quite healthy although aging greatly with each passing day. He found motivation to work for the Ilyichs as much as he could so as to support his mother and himself. Each night when he went home to his mother and told her of his experience with Mr. Ilyich, she would extol his gentle heart and giving manner. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so much like your father,&rdquo; she would say. He would always smile and give a little shrug as though his actions were small. Yet, what may have seemed small to Gerasim was colossal to his dying friend Ivan Ilyich. </p>

<p align="center"><span class="style6">3 )<em> The Early Days of Ivan Ilyich</em><br>
by Lee Hyde</span> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many men were born that summer.&nbsp; It was called a harvest season, for reasons obviously different from the crops.&nbsp; They used say that those born on the full moon were destined for failure.&nbsp; There is something about being born on the full moon that makes people submissive and willing to succumb to life&rsquo;s pressures.&nbsp; Ivan Ilyich is no different&mdash;a man born on the fullest moon in the clearest sky in the middle of the harvest season.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivan&rsquo;s mother used to coddle him and rock him to sleep.&nbsp; She would sing lullabies to him gently as he drifted into a dazed slumber.&nbsp; Ivan&rsquo;s mother, Alena, was a strong woman.&nbsp; She believed in dominating the household and having her lavish desires realized.&nbsp; It was Alena that called upon Ivan&rsquo;s father, Dimitri, to build the biggest house and be the most impressive family in the city.&nbsp; Dimitri felt differently, of course, as most men do when it pertains to money, and felt that a more modest upbringing would be best for Ivan.&nbsp; He looked at his son as an heir, but desired above all that Ivan remain honest and deserving.&nbsp; Dimitri did not wish to marry Alena, but took her to guarantee Ivan&rsquo;s future destiny.&nbsp; He had been an official of Petersburg, and he enjoyed quite the well-to-do life from his pay.&nbsp; Alena desired that wealth and wore it like a badge.&nbsp; She often considered Ivan another jewel in her display case, because she saw something special when she looked at him.&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t place the emotion, because she had never felt it before, but she knew it was special with Ivan.&nbsp; She felt love for a person&mdash;genuine love.&nbsp; It was strange indeed because she did not seem to share this emotion with her other two sons.&nbsp; Ivan was her only true blood, whereas he other two children were stepchildren, brought in by marriage.&nbsp; Ivan was the only real connection she had with another life, and the inherent emotions that connect to that bond flooded her soul.&nbsp; Because of that, she spoiled Ivan, and gave him everything a child could desire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivan grew into a silver-spooned adolescent who nonetheless, had a rough time participating in social functions.&nbsp; He was always somewhat removed from the scene, as if he was not quite familiar with human interaction.&nbsp; People would often say that this was due to his mother&rsquo;s coddling, and that she never once let him out of her sight until he was ready to become fully independent.&nbsp; Ivan did not notice the social differences between himself and the other school children.&nbsp; He instead focused most of his attention and haste to succeed in other areas of his life, such as his career aspirations.&nbsp; He had little time for schoolyard crushes, except for one day.&nbsp; He saw the most beautiful creature striding across the playground, and he knew he felt a different emotion.&nbsp; He was deeply attracted to her that he decided to become a man she would adore.&nbsp; He began to develop into a social butterfly, making time to learn how to interact with his peers.&nbsp; Ivan transformed for her, because she caused him to love.&nbsp; Because of his transformation, he became a good-natured young man, with social skills that would be later tested in life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, that girl never returned Ivan&rsquo;s interest, and he felt resentment and despair because of it.&nbsp; He returned his attention to his career, and knew he must continue his family&rsquo;s wealthy status in order to become successful in life.&nbsp; He wanted to make his family proud, but most importantly had a void where most have self-esteem and he felt a need to fill that void.&nbsp; So, Ivan went to the School of Law, and did quite well there.&nbsp; He excelled in his studies, and upon graduation had a well positioned job.&nbsp; He eventually moved up to be a member of the Court of Justice, rightfully on top of his game and a member of the government like his father.&nbsp; Of course, like his father, he had a job with a very good pay.&nbsp; Ivan appreciated himself, and he felt the need for self-indulgence.&nbsp; Underneath though, he always regretted his first failed attempt at love, so he sought to make himself more desirable.&nbsp; He spent great amounts of wealth on himself, to pamper and prod and mold himself into becoming a desirable creature.&nbsp; Unfortunately, most women assumed he was arrogant and distasteful.&nbsp; He had to work ten times harder, and still nothing worked.&nbsp; Finally, he took the only woman who would have him, Praskovya Fedorovna Golovina, because he knew he must take a wife to be complete.&nbsp; He did not particularly love Praskovya.&nbsp; But he knew she would do as a wife.&nbsp; In fact, their marriage was fairly successful in the beginning.&nbsp; She grew, as he did, to love a wealthy life.&nbsp; She believed in self-indulgence as much as he did, and treated herself to it as much as possible.&nbsp; Of course, in public they appeared to be modest and reserved, but only for reputation&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; No one liked a rampant brag, and neither of them wanted to be outcasts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But then Praskovya became pregnant, and their marriage slowly drifted.&nbsp; Ivan was not ready to be a father, and he resented his wife for putting him into the ordeal.&nbsp; He blamed her as if he had no part in creating the child.&nbsp; He enjoyed the free life he had experienced all of his life.&nbsp; And he didn&rsquo;t want to give that up.&nbsp; But most importantly, his daughter Lisa looked so much like his first love that escaped.&nbsp; And it pained him to see his daughter, because it reminded him of the heartbreak that he once felt.&nbsp; His daughter also developed the same sense of self-importance and indulgence that he formally tried to imitate.&nbsp; But this time he despised the treatment, and wished for a more caring daughter.&nbsp; He felt as though his daughter was everything he had worked to overcome since his early days, and she was stomping on his heart.</p>
<p>Praskovya had one other child, a boy, before Ivan grew sick.&nbsp; Vladimir, Lisa&rsquo;s junior by 3 years, was a caring son, and ultimately the only blood kin that would understand Ivan&rsquo;s suffering.&nbsp; Ivan and Vladimir felt a bond that only father and son can share, and Vladimir felt pity for his father.&nbsp; He also felt responsible for his father&rsquo;s wellbeing, and felt it necessary to become a caretaker.&nbsp; Ivan grew increasing resentful of his wife and daughter, because neither of them showed care or remorse for him.&nbsp; Neither of them showed respect and admiration like Vladimir did.&nbsp; Vladimir was the son whose affection was too late in Ivan&rsquo;s life to make a difference.&nbsp; Ivan would grow very sick, and his only solace was his son&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; He longed for the same from his wife and daughter, but he would never experience that again during his life.</p>

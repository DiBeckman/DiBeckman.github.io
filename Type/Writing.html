<p class="style2">Writing </p>
<p class="style1">All sixteen types can write clearly and well. All can also experience anxiety about writing (&quot;writer's block&quot;) at times. As with learning styles, people of each type have their unique approach to writing. <br />
  <br />
  There are two guidelines for succeeding.<br />
  <span class="style3">&bull;</span>
  Trust and use your preferred style, especially on the first draft. Do whatever it takes to get your momentum going and to give you a sense of confidence. <br /> 
  <span class="style3">&bull;</span> Revise your draft according to your instructor's expectation, but do these revisions as near to the due date as possible. <br />
  <br />
  The table below shows the writing approaches typically preferred by people of each MBTI preference. Using one or more of the strategies associated with your preferences can help you get started and avoid feeling blocked.<br />

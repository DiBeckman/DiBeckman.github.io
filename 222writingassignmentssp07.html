</a>This site is very cool because it has sound clips and draws from a wide range of speeches, movies, and more to illustrate the Figures of Speech.

  1) Read <em>Essay on Man</em> and write a page  to turn in about your stanza to turn in. What is it about? Give a one sentence summary. Answer the 4 questions from Shannon. Also, what are the key words and images in the stanza? How does the stanza connect with the ideas of the Enlightenment we've discussed? What is the attitude of the narrator? What is the role of nature, especially animals, if any appear in your stanza?</p>
<p class="style2">2)<span class="style7"> <span class="style16">After reading Shannon Chapter 1, write your own definition of literature to turn in. Make it as short and complete as possible.</span></span></p>

  <br />
  <span class="style7">Class 4 (Voltaire, Lecture 1) <span class="style13">due Friday, January 19 </span> <br />
1) </span>Your WebCT introductory post is due at midnight on Wednesday. </p>
<p><span class="style7"><span class="style16">2) Write a page about the first thirteen chapters of <em>Candide</em> answering Shannon's 4 questions. </span></span></p>
<p class="style2">3) Read Shannon, Chapter 2. </p>
<p class="style2">4) Print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222ShortStoryNovel.html">Different Forms of Prose Fiction</a>; <a href="222SatireIronyUtopia.html">Satire, Irony and Utopia</a>, <a href="222Panglossian.htm">Panglossian</a>.</p>
<p class="style2">5) Consider bookmarking an online dictionary or two to make it easy to look up words you don't know. If you are doing the Reading Notebook, you can print out the definitions to include in your notebook. <br />
    <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/">http://dictionary.reference.com/</a><br />
  <a href="http://www.m-w.com/">http://www.m-w.com/</a></p>
<p class="style2"><span class="style8">Class 5 (Voltaire, Lecture 2) <span class="style13">due Monday, Jan. 22 </span><br />
      <span class="style4">Discuss the following question after you do the reading. Is Eldorado a genuine utopia or (in one critic's words) &quot;a colossal bore&hellip;satirized by Voltaire as foolish and futile&quot;? Which specific behaviors or institutions show us that Voltaire wants us to see Eldorado as utopic?  Does Voltaire have a philosophical lesson in mind or is it pure satire? Or both?</span></span> How does it correspond to your view of Utopia? <span class="style4">Quote from the text with examples to support your answers.</span></p>
<p class="style2">See Lecture Notes on <a href="222dulce.html">Dulce et utile</a> ; read Shannon, Chapter 3. </p>
<p class="style2">The first original contribution post&mdash;on Pope&mdash;is due Monday at midnight. You will have many authors to choose from to do your required 13 posts (7 original contributions and 6 responses), but I encourage you to get in the habit of posting by starting with Pope or Voltaire. For an original contribution post, make a point or develop an argument of at least 7 lines based on something you read, learned or thought while reading <em>An Essay on Man</em>. It can be helpful to ask a question or make a provocative statement for your classmates to respond to. Did something in your homework get praise or a lot of comment from me? If so, it might be the basis of a good post. </p>
<p class="style2"><span class="style7">Class 6 (Voltaire, Lecture 3)</span> <span class="style13">due Wednesday, Jan. 24 </span><br />
  Read the page in Supplementary Materials, <a href="Candide%20quotes.html">Quotes from different critics about &quot;Il faut cultiver notre jardin.&quot; </a><br />
  Write a page answering the following questions: what are some  literal and figurative meanings of the word <em>garden</em>? How do they apply here? How do <strong>you</strong> interpret the final line of the story?</p>
<p class="style2">What do I mean by <strong>literal</strong> and <strong>figurative</strong>? Here is an example I found online at <a href="http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm">http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm</a> : <br />
  <br />  
<strong>literal</strong> vs. <strong>figurative</strong> meaning - relates to the meanings of words and phrases or expressions. For example, &quot;She was all ears&quot; has a <strong>figurative</strong> meaning (She was listening intently) as well as a <strong>literal</strong> meaning (Her body was composed of ears or she had a huge set of ears). </p>

Several of you have asked about doing homework assignments in advance. The best suggestion I have for getting ahead would be to look at last semester's <a href="222writingassignmentsfa06.htm">Daily Writing Assignments page</a> . I reserve right to tweak assignments, but that should give you an idea of what you are likely to be asked to do. </p>

  <span class="style32"><span class="style33">Section 1<br />
  </span>&bull; FORMALIST CRITICISM:<br />
  </span></span><span class="style34">How do the secondary characters influence story/plot? How does Leon influence Ema's decisions and character? </span><span class="style31"><span class="style32"><br />
  <br />
&bull; </span></span><span class="style32">SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM<br />
  &nbsp; Marxist Criticism: </span><span class="style32"><span class="style13"><em>Madame Bovary</em> has numerous social settings with different classes present in each. Also it is apparent that Emma is obsessed with the upper class and wishes desperately to be a part of their exclusive group. Why does Flaubert devote so much of his work to the different descriptions of the social classes? Is there a hidden message here; if so, what is it?</span><br />
  <br />
&nbsp; Feminist Criticism:<br />
</span><span class="style22">&bull; How is Emma's life portrayed in the work? Does the fact that she rejects her role and accepts it on occasion say anything about the oppression of women or if there is justification for her behavior? <br />
  &bull;Why do you think Emma is never satisfied? Is Flaubert's discontent wiht his life a parallel to Emma's dissatisfaction wiht love? Does Flaubert overexaggerate Emma's expectations on purpose?<br /> 
  &bull; What is the relationship between men and women in this work and how does their relationship cause or resolve conflict throughout the work? <br />
  &bull; Considering the realist them of the story, how does Flaubert portray women, specifically Emma? How does this differ from the way women are portrayed in today's society? Explain whether Emma accepts or rejects this role and give examples supporting your answer. <br />
  &bull; Why does Emma have so much power over Charles in a time in history where women don't have that much socioeconomic or political power?<br />
  &bull; How are women's lives portrayed in the work. Do they accept or reject these roles?</span><span class="style32"><br /> 
  <br />
&bull; 
  CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICSM: <br />
  </span><span class="style6">&bull; How does the culture and society of living in a small country town affect Emma? Is this what caused her to be unhappy? <br />
  &bull; During the time period of Madame Bovary, was the sanctity of marriage regarded in the same way that it is today? Was it more or less highly regarded? <br />
  &bull; What was Flaubert's view on the social structure at the time of the story, and how did he express that in <em>Madame Bovary</em>? <br />
  &bull; How does Charles' attitude about marriage and adultery reflect the time in which the story was written? <br />
</span><span class="style32"> <br />
&bull; 
  PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </span><span class="style32"><br />
  <span class="style35">&bull; What was the overal mood that could be tied together 
  by all of the characters' personalities and characteristics. Could the author have intended for this novel to represent his personal life? <br />
  &bull; Madame Bovary was always dreaming of the classy life that she never got. She was always trying to associate herself with other people of the upper class. Even after she got married, she still did not realize the reality. What is strange is that she had a child. Usually people who have children are busy taking care of them. What happened to her maternal instincts? Why didn't that help her snap out of her dreams and bring her to reality? <br />
  &bull; Do the dreams and desires of the main character Emma reveal anything to us about the dreams and desires of Flaubert or someone close to him? Do her actions reflect his or someone close to him?  <br />
  &bull; What view does Flaubert want readers to have of Madame Bovary, given that there are three characters who share that name. What mindset does Flaubert want the readers to develop of this character? <br />
  &bull; Why is it so hard for Emma to accept her situation and why does she have to ruin things for everyone else, especially her daughter? </span><br />
  <br />
  &bull;
  READER RESPONSE CRITICISM: </span><span class="style33"><br />
  <span class="style36">&bull;Which character do you find it hardest to relate to? Why?<br />
  &bull;What was your reaction to Leon's open flirtation with Emma when they meet?<br />
&bull; Emma believes that she can in some way change the way the world is. She thinks that  </span></span><span class="style36">every new thing that comes into her life will make her happy. Why is this unrealistic? How are Emma's actions and decisions affected by her needs and views on life? </span></p>
<p class="style2"><span class="style22">Section 2</span><br />
  <span class="style31"><span class="style32">&bull; FORMALIST CRITICISM:<br />
</span></span><span class="style34">&bull; How does Emma's suicide, and the consequential end it puts to her cycle of hope and misery,  play a role in the overall meaning and lesson of the novel?</span><span class="style31"><span class="style32"> <br />
<br />
&bull; </span></span><span class="style32">SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM<br />
&nbsp; Marxist Criticism:<br />
</span><span class="style13">&bull; How do economic conditions determine the characters' lives?<br />
&bull; How does Emma's dependence on credit influence her actions, especially towards Charles?<br />
&bull; What motivations or reasons does L'Heureux have to allow Emma to dig her own financial (and literal) grave? How do these reasons reflect Romanticism and Realism?</span><span class="style32"><br />
</span><span class="style13">&bull; In 
<em>Madame Bovary</em>, are upper class women or male servants in a better social class? How does Flaubert show this? <br />
</span><span class="style32"> <br />
&nbsp; Feminist Criticism:<br />
</span><span class="style22">&bull; What does the fact that Emma wants a baby boy show about women's role in society in this book and during the time that it was written?<br />
&bull; How is Emma Bovary viewed by the townspeople when they suspect her of being unfaithful?<br />
&bull; Is Emma's perception of women's roles in society similar to other women in the novel? in her historical time period?<br />
&bull; How does Emma feel about the traditional roles of women? Does she feel trapped or does she use this to her advantage?<br />
&bull; How do men and women reveal their feelings differently in <em>Madame Bovary</em>? (Does this correspond to your personal experience?)<br />
&bull; How does Emma's behavior compare to the other women in the novel? Is their behavior akin to the expectations of that time?<br />
&bull; How does Madame Bovary's role as mother fall within the lines of feminism while either strengthening the feminist view or devaluing it?<br />
&bull; How
are today's women different from the women in <em>Madame Bovary</em>'s time? <br />
&bull; In which incidents in <em>Madame Bovary</em> does Flaubert  show an understanding of the hardships of women in this time period? </span><span class="style32"><br />
<br />
&bull; 
    CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICSM:<br />
    </span><span class="style6">&bull; Why does Flaubert have a Romantic character in a Realist novel?<br />
    &bull; How historically accurate is the novel?<br />
    &bull; How do social considerations play an important role in courtship in <em>Madame Bovary</em>?<br />
    &bull; What are the reasons  
 that Emma desires a male child?<br />
 &bull; How did Flaubert utilize the themes and views of the Enlightenment, Romantic, and Realist periods to shape his characters?<br />
&bull; Did Flaubert's use of the science vs. religion debate shape the characters in strong ways? How so?<br />
&bull; How does the work reflect the period it represents? 
    </span><span class="style32"><br />
    <br />
&bull; 
    PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM:<br />
    </span><span class="style35">&bull; Emma seems to have trouble making the right decision throughout the novel. What was the movitation behind her actions? Was she destroying her life and the lives of those around her intentionally or were her actions inadvertent?<br />
&bull; Is Charles' first marriage the reason he felt so strongly for Emma or would he feel that way even without that bad experience? How does Emma's experience in the convent shape the way she acts in life and towards Charles?<br />
&bull;Would Emma truly have been happy in the long run had she in fact eloped with either Leon or Rodolphe?<br />
&bull; Is it possible for Emma to be happy in the long run at all?<br /> 
&bull; Did Flaubert possibly have bad relationships with women in his past that caused him to share Emma's character the way he did?<br />
    </span><span class="style32"><br />
&bull;
  READER RESPONSE CRITICISM</span>:<br />
  <span class="style36">&bull;What is the sound out in the forest on page 1133?<br />
&bull; How would someone react toward this novel, and Emma in particular, if they were from an impoverished lifestyle in comparison to someone who currently lives the way Emma dreams of living?<br />
&bull; Do you sympathize with Emma, a Romantic stuck in a very realist situation, or the character of Charles, who is happy only because he is so naive, more deserving of our sympathy?</span></p>

</font>Father, an intellectual, marries a lower class woman; they have a son, but the Father becomes bored with his wife and sends her off to live with his male secretary. Father keeps custody of the Son, who is raised by a wet nurse and grows up to be very resentful. The wife obediently leaves the family home and she and the former secretary have 3 more children. The Father watches over them, but eventually they move away; the stepfather dies, and the wife and three children move back to the original town without telling the Father. Mother and Stepdaughter take jobs with a dressmaker, Madame Pace, who runs a call-girl service: Mother as a seamstress, Stepdaughter as a prostitute, who is ultimately hired by the Father. Family is reunited: explosive conflict.</p>

2) Also: </span><span class="style2">&quot;The Oedipus complex in Freudian psychoanalysis refers to stage of psychosexual development in childhood where children of both sexes regard their father as an adversary and competitor for the exclusive love of their mother. The name of the complex derives from the Greek myth of Oedipus, who unwittingly kills his father Laius and marries his mother Jocasta.<br />
<br />
  Freud considered the successful resolution of the Oedipus complex to be key to the development of gender roles and identity, with boys and girls resolving the conflicts differently as a result of castration anxiety and penis envy. Freud also held that the unsuccessful resolution of the Oedipus complex could result in neurosis and homosexuality.&hellip; Although common usage refers to 'suffering from an Oedipus complex', psychoanalysis does not consider the complex a pathology, but instead a perfectly normal stage that all children go through. Oedipal desires are thought to remain heavily repressed and unconsciously in the minds of all functioning adults.</span>&quot; <br />

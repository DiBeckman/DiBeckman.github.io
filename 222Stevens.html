  Wallace Stevens</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#147;Imagination 
  is the power that enables us to perceive the normal in the abnormal, the opposite 
  of chaos in chaos. It does this every day in arts and letters.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &#147;The great poems of heaven and earth have been written and the great poem 
  of the earth remains to be written.&#148;<br>
  <br>
  &#147;A poet looks at the world as a man looks at a woman.&#148; <br>
  &#147;The opposite of &#145;fiction&#146; is not &#145;truth&#146; but &#145;fact&#146;.<br>
  <br>
  Notes toward a Supreme Fiction <br>
  1) It Must Be Abstract<br>
  2) It Must Change<br>
  3) It Must Give Pleasure<br>
  <br>
  &#147;The poem refreshes life so that we share/ For a moment the first idea.&#148;

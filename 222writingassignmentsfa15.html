    <li>What is familiar?</li>

  <p>*This and all subsequent references to Shannon are from Edward Shannon's <span class="text">The Prentice Hall Guide to Writing about Literature</span> (Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2002) which went out of print in 2010. I  replaced it with <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> as a textbook for our class. Details about what he means by &quot;confusing, repeated, familiar and strange&quot; can be found <a href="222Shannonmore.html">here</a>.</p>
  <p>Write a one-paragraph to one-page summary of Chapter 1 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>. Include the title of each chapter in your heading, since   it should reflect the main point of the chapter. Your summary should include the main points and any others that seem especially helpful or surprising to you. Some students prefer to an outline format or question format. (See <a href="222ShortGuideSample.pdf">this example</a> of a question format and <a href="222ASGoutline.pdf">this example</a> of an outline format.) Outlining, writing questions, and summarizing are all useful skills. You may handwrite or type it, and you may include it on the same page with your discussion of the first stanza of <span class="text">Essay on Man. </span>You may submit<span class="text"> A Short Guide</span> assignments electronically since I will not make extensive comments on them. If they are submitted electronically, they will be returned to you electronically. </p>
  <p> Print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222Enlightenment.html">The Enlightenment</a> and <a href="222GreatChain.html">The Great Chain of Being</a> if you want to use them to take notes.</p>
<p>In addition, for this and the next assignment, take a look at  my web page on <a href="Explication.html"><em>Explication de Texte</em></a> and these web sites about figures of speech which are also listed on the handy <a href="222supmatf04.html">Supplementary Materials</a> page. These pages will  be useful for your <a href="222poetrypresentation.html">Poetry Presentation</a> due on <span class="date">September 11 and 14</span>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Here is <a href="http://grammar.about.com/od/terms/a/revquiz20terms.htm?p=1">a quiz</a> you can take to assess your knowledge of the &quot;Top 20 figures of speech&quot; by Richard Norquist.</li>
    <li> <a href="http://www.nipissingu.ca/faculty/williams/figofspe.htm">This site</a> contains figures of speech, thought, repetition, more than you can shake a stick at! Most examples are drawn from Shakespeare. </li>
    <li> <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/rhetoricaldevicesinsound.htm">This site</a> is very cool because it has sound clips and draws from a wide range of speeches, movies, and more to illustrate the Figures of Speech. For example, see and listen to quotes from Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln, and Neil Armstrong on <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/figures/antithesis.htm">the page about antitheses</a>.</li>

  <ol>
    <li>Read <span class="text">Essay on Man</span> and write a page about your stanza to turn in. In case you're not sure what a <em>stanza</em> is, you can look this and other literary terms up in our course <a href="222Glossary.html">Glossary</a>, the Glossary in Appendix B of <span class="text">A Short Guide to Writing About Literature</span>, or the <a href="http://wwnorton.com/college/english/nawest9/literaryterms.aspx">Glossary</a> on the Norton web site.<br />
      <br />
Note that the Roman numerals I-X at the beginning of each stanza correspond to your assigned stanza number (not a page or line number). What is the stanza about? Give a one-sentence summary. Answer  Shannon's 4 questions. Also, what are the key words and images in the stanza? How does the stanza connect with the ideas of the Enlightenment we've discussed? What is  the attitude of the narrator? What is the role of nature, especially animals, if any appear in your stanza?</li>
    <li>Write a one-paragraph to one-page summary or outline of Chapter 2 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> to turn in. Take, correct, and turn in your answers to the Quiz in Appendix B  364-371 of <span class="text">A Short Guide.</span></li>

<h2 class="class">Class 5 (Voltaire, Lecture 2) <span class="date">due Friday, August 28</span></h2>
<ul><li> Discuss the following questions after you do the reading assignment (Chapters 14-22). Quote from the text with examples to support your answers and include the page reference for each quotation.
          <ul>
            <li>Is Eldorado a genuine utopia or (in one critic's words) &quot;a colossal bore&hellip;satirized by Voltaire as foolish and futile&quot;?</li>
            <li>Which specific behaviors or institutions show us that Voltaire wants the reader to see Eldorado as utopic?</li>
            <li>Does Voltaire have a philosophical lesson in mind or is it pure satire? Or both?</li>
            <li>How does it correspond to your personal view of Utopia?</li></ul>
        </li>
</ul>
<ul><li>See Lecture Notes on <a href="222dulce.html">Dulce et utile</a>.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Read Chapter 3 in <em>A Short Guide</em> and write a summary to turn in.</li></ul>
 <ul><li>The first original contribution post&mdash;on Pope&mdash;is due <span class="date">tonight</span> at midnight. You will have many authors to choose from to do your required 14 posts (7 original contributions and 7 responses), but I encourage you to get in the habit of posting by starting with Pope or Voltaire. For an original contribution post, make a point or develop an argument of at least <span class="red">one  full paragraph (5-8 sentences)</span> based on something you read, learned or thought while reading <em>An Essay on Man</em>. Ask a question or make a provocative statement for your classmates to respond to. You may also include a quote from the text under discussion or links to other web sites. Did something in your homework get praise or a lot of comment from me? If so, it might be the basis of a good post.
</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="class">Class 6 (Voltaire, Lecture 3)</span> <span class="date">due Monday, August 31</span></h2>
 <p>Read the page in Supplementary Materials, <a href="Candide%20quotes.html">Quotes from different critics about &quot;Il faut cultiver notre jardin.&quot;</a> Write a page which includes answers to the following questions: what are some  literal and figurative meanings of the word <em>garden</em>? How do they apply to Candide's garden? How do <strong>you</strong> interpret the final line of the story? </p>
 <p>To help you to understand the difference between <strong>literal</strong> and <strong>figurative</strong>, here is  an example I found online:</p>
 <blockquote>
   <p><strong>literal</strong> vs. <strong>figurative</strong> meaning - relates to the meanings of words and phrases or expressions. For example, &quot;She was all ears&quot; has a <strong>figurative</strong> meaning (She was listening intently) as well as a <strong>literal</strong> meaning (Her body was composed of ears or she had a huge set of ears). <span class="citation"><a href="http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm">Literary Terms for English</a></span></p>

   </li>
 </ul>
 <ol>
   <div class="maroon">
     <h3>FORMALIST CRITICISM:</h3>
     <ul>
       <li>Emma Bovary is in a constant state of switching back and forth between being a wild woman that dreams of running off with men and enjoying the finer things in life, and then returning to be a woman of the household and begins to put an emphasis on living a Godly life. From the time we are introduced to Emma, we know she was at a convent, married to Charles but wanted to live in a world of finer things, falls for Leon, is abandoned by Leon, goes back to trying to be a somewhat of a good wife, falls for Rodolphe and spends money on finer things, is abandoned by Rodolphe, goes to a life of living Godly, and again falls for Leon and begins to indulge in spending more money than before. Emma’s character would suggest that she is simply trying to find happiness, happiness that will brighten up her so-called dull life. But even if Emma gets her happiness, she must always go through a period of depression. The form of <em>Madame Bovary</em> is mainly about Emma going back and forth but always ending in the same result. So is all of this flip-flopping in Emma’s character the single most defining aspect of this story? Or is there another aspect(s) that would better define this story?</li>
     </ul>
   </div>
   <h3>SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
   <div class="red">
     <h4>Marxist Criticism:</h4>
     <ul>
       <li>How does Emma's extravagant personality contribute to her hypocritical classism and socioeconomic status in <em>Madame Bovary</em>?</li>
       <li>When you first meet someone, what is the first thing you evaluate (the person's face, eyes, clothes, shoes, etc.)? In the story, when two people meet they usually evaluate the other's fingernails. What was so revealing about fingernails in regards to social class, profession, or wealth? What does this reveal regarding the priorities of society during that time? </li>
     </ul>
   </div>
   <div class="purple">
     <h4>Feminist Criticism: </h4>
     <ul>
       <li>Emma is constantly burdened with the gender injustices of her time. In the story, she desperately wishes for a son so that her child will have the freedoms she never could. One could argue that this desire is perhaps the most prominent maternal moment that she has throughout the story regarding her child. Do you think that if she had gotten her wish and birthed a son, she would have been more devoted to her role of motherhood or rejected it just the same simply because it is a symbol of her set role and marriage? Do you think, had Emma had a son, she would have the potential to turn into Old Madame Bovary, who lives vicariously Charles?</li>
       <li>Emma is seen as a dramatic person in this story. Do you think this is because during this time period females were not really allowed to do anything without permission of men? Is it possible that if Emma was transported into this time period that she would ultimately become a different person do to the fact that she would have more to do? Do you think Charles ignores her unhappiness due the fact that Emma is female?</li>
       <li>Does Flaubert's depiction of Emma's choices and behavior of striving to be a &quot;lady&quot; possibly reflect his views of women or humanity in general? (Taking into account her adulterous behavior and the fact that she, by trying to achieve for herself the things she wants, actually strays away from proper &quot;ladylike&quot; behavior)</li>
       <li>Often in the novel it is evident that Emma has more ambition than Charles and wishes him to have more ambition (The Hippolyte incident). While Charles is meek, foolish, and underspoken, Emma is opinionated, full of aspirations and is one to take initiative. Charles takes on more feminine qualities while Emma takes on more masculine ones. What statement is Flaubert possibly trying to make here regarding women's roles in marriage and society? </li>
       <li>If Emma had married someone like Leon or Rodolphe, do you think she would have been happy and well? Or is her sickness and spending her way of asserting herself and drawing attention to herself in a male-dominated time period?</li>
       <li>According to Emma, she is &quot;powerless&quot; being a woman. Is she truly powerless? Do her actions reflect something different? Does the era she is living in influence her opinions of her seemingly impossible situations? How does Flaubert portray her?</li>
     </ul>
   </div>
   <div class="teal">
     <h3>CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
     <ul>
       <li>As we are all aware, there is quite a bit of irony and sarcasm by Flaubert in<em> Madame Bovary</em>. However we are aware of this because we know what period this novel was written in. If someone was unaware it was written in a realist time period, would they think this is a romantic novel? Do you think Flaubert wrote this with intentions of people to read it hundreds of years later and analyze the differences between realism and romanticism? What would you say are the greatest factors to recognize that this novel was written during the realist period?</li>
       <li>What major leaders or celebrities of the time period may have influenced Flaubert's <em>Madame Bovary</em>?</li>
       <li>Is the idea of marriage more or less unbreakable and sacred today than it was when marriage vows could not be broken (until death do us part)?</li>
       <li>Before reading this story, we were told that Flaubert had originally wanted to write romantic pieces of work, but his friends mocked him a lot for it, causing him to change directions and write a realist piece; however, do you think that characters like Emma and Leon, who are clearly meant more for the romantic period, are his way of incorporating his original desire? Do you think he can relate most to them because that's the kind of writing he initially wanted to write?</li>
     </ul>
   </div>
   <div class="orange">
     <p><strong>PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</strong></p>
     <ul>
       <li>Madame Bovary's outlook on life shifted immensely when she began reading romance novels at the convent. From then on she is constantly yearning for a more romantic life--mostly revolving around her relationships. Is this Flaubert's way of commenting on the psychological desires humans have? Do you believe that Madame Bovary is conscious of her desires for a romantic lifestyle?</li>
       <li>Psychological Criticism<br />
         While reading fiction stories, I have always wondered if the plot of the story is impacted and formed around the author's personal life. After contemplating, I concluded that the plot almost has to be connected to the author's experiences in one way or another, whether it is consciously or unconsciously. After reading about the personal life of Flaubert, I found out that he never got married. Do you think his shame and frustration of not finding &quot;the one&quot; is portrayed through Emma's romantic frustrations? If so, how? [<a href="http://www.online-literature.com/gustave-flaubert/">http://www.online-literature.com/gustave-flaubert/</a>]</li>
       <li></li>
     </ul>
   </div>
   <div class="blue">
     <h3>READER RESPONSE CRITICISM:</h3>
     <ul>
       <li>How did you respond to the character of Emma Bovary? Do you think Flaubert intended her to be sympathetic at all? Would she garner more sympathy in a modern setting where she would surely be diagnosed with a mental disorder such as bipolar disorder or where her consumerist ways are more commonplace?</li>
       <li>Do you feel a connection to any of the characters in <em>Madame Bovary</em>? Which character? Do you believe this affects your interpretation of the story? How?</li>
     </ul>
   </div>
   <div class="green">
     <h3>ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
     <ul>
       <li>The story takes place in the French countryside which makes it impossible for Charles to stay at home and see all of his clients.  Would the affair with Rodolphe have happened if Charles had lived in a city where his clients only came to see him?</li>
     </ul>
   </div>
   <div class="fuchsia">
     <h3>QUEER THEORY: </h3>
     <ul>
       <li>&quot;How does the concept of heteronormativity (the idea that all characters are considered heterosexual until stated otherwise) impact the story in regards to who is attracted to Emma, or vice-versa?&quot;</li>
     </ul>

<div class="maroon">
  <h3>FORMALIST CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How does Gregor’s cockroach behavior of hiding under the settee during the story relate to his life before his metamorphosis?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h3>SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
<div class="red">
  <h4>Marxist Criticism:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>How do the economic circumstances of Gregor&rsquo;s family affect their living and working situations?</li>
    <li>Was Gregor emotionally fulfilled by his job as a salesman? What weight does his family place on socioeconomic status verses emotional family connection?<br />
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="purple">
  <h4>Feminist Criticism: </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>How do the two women in the story, Grete and Gregor's mother, play differing roles as far as Gregor's care goes and how do they reflect or contrast the typical roles and behavior of women during the time?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="teal">
  <h3>CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How does this story reflect the ideas citizens had about WWI and all the horror and death that was taking place in Europe?</li>
    <li>How could the historical context of Kafka’s life play into <em>The Metamorphosis</em>?</li>
    <li>In <em>The Metamorphosis</em> the main character, Gregor Samsa is transformed into a cockroach overnight. While reading this story I couldn&rsquo;t help but think of a painting I saw at the M.C. Escher exhibit at the North Carolina Museum of Art. The painting is entitled &ldquo;Dream,&rdquo; and features a giant praying mantis sitting on top of a sleeping priest. The praying mantis is almost looking back at the viewer as if he/she is interrupting its sinister plans. With this in mind, why would insects serve as a source of inspiration for artists during the period of Modernism? <br />

<div class="orange">
  <h3>PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How does the author present psychological matters such as the effects of isolation?</li>
    <li>Can the first half of this story reflect ordeals that have occurred in Kafka's personal life and how is it connected to Gregor's psychological feelings in the story? 
    </li>
    <li>Is it possible that Gregor Samsa was already an extremely isolated human being with no communications with the outside world, and this metamorphosis is just Gregor's huge epiphany, where he comes to terms with who he has become? What is the evidence in the story to support this idea?</li>
    <li>When Gregor turned why did the his family not just kill him? Why did they shove him back into his room?</li>

  <h3>READER RESPONSE CRITICISM:</h3>

      <p>Based on personal experiences and prior knowledge of the title's meaning, what do you believe is the significance of Gregor turning into a giant insect [monstrous vermin]?

<h2><span class="class">Class 34 (Thesis exercise and Peer review of Term Paper proposal) </span><span class="date">due Friday, November 13</span></h2>
<p>All mid-term revisions are due.</p>
<p>The final organized, <span class="extracredit">extra credit</span> <a href="222ArtMuseumVisit.html">museum visit</a> is <span class="date">tonight, Friday, November 13</span>. <a href="mailto:Diane_Beckman@ncsu.edu">Email</a><a href="mailto:dibeckman@earthlink.net"></a> me to sign up. All papers on the required art museum visit are due by <span class="date">Wednesday, November 18.</span></p>
<p>The first part of class will be devoted to <em>The Thesis Exercise</em>. Read the <a href="222Thesis exercise.html">web page</a> about how to write a thesis for a literary paper. Print and fill out the <a href="222Theses.html">page of sample FL 222 theses</a> where you rate the examples. The second half of class will be devoted to peer review of the first pre-draft of your <a href="222Paper2010.html">Paper</a>. </p>
<p>Print out <strong>two copies</strong> of the <a href="Peerevaluation2.pdf">Peer Review Feedback Form</a> to include with the <strong>two copies</strong> of your draft which you will bring for your classmates. Fill out the top part of the form with your name, paper title, and date. Do <strong>not wait</strong> until the last minute to print these materials out. Email me before class if you have an idea for your own original topic so that I can approve it. Speaking of original, a very creative paper where almost all the main characters meet in Hell written by a former student is featured <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~dsbeckma/To Hell with Literature.htm"> here</a>, and my favorite missing chapter of <em>Candide</em> is <a href="222VoltaireCandide.html">here</a>. The complete first draft will be due to me on <span class="date">Monday, November 23.</span></p>
<p>Selected writing advice from the <a href="222Paper2010.html">Term Paper page:</a></p>
<p>Read through the topic choices below. Consult Chapter 10 in <span class="text"> A Short Guide, Writing about Fiction: the World of the Story</span>, especially the pages on &quot;Getting Ideas&quot; (171-5).  Which texts have been your favorite or challenged you the most? Send me an email or make an appointment if you need help deciding on a topic. <span class="red">If you are doing a creative project, you will not have a <strong>thesis </strong>per se in your rough draft, but you will replace that with a <strong>story premise </strong>that explains what the goal of your project is and how it relates to the text(s) you are responding to. </span></p>
<h2>Paper Topics</h2>
<p><strong>A. Critical creative rewriting</strong></p>
<p>You become the author/artist. Take one of your favorite stories, poems or plays and imagine what happens to the characters after the story ends. You could also rewrite the story before it starts or focus on an important scene from a <em>different</em> character's point of view: Cun&eacute;gonde's, Berthe's or Gerasim's&hellip; One student rewrote Pope's <span class="text">Essay on Man</span> in the format of Baudelaire's &quot;Enivirez-vous.&quot; You could also write a letter from one character to another in the same story or a different story. For example: What advice would Rodolphe give Ashenbach? For a model, see <a href="http://grammar.about.com/od/classicessays/a/franklinmis.htm">Ben Franklin's letter of &quot;Advice on Choosing a Mistress</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the author's narrative style, plot, characterization, vocabulary and imagery, so that you can imitate it (or even make a parody of it). If you use direct quotes from the original text, put these passages <em>in italics. </em>Include the page reference for your quote. Do not include historical anachronisms, such as a telephone in <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> or snooze button on Gregor's alarm clock.</p>
<p> The <strong>creative</strong> part of the paper should be two to three pages long. </p>
<p>The second half of the paper will be the <strong>critical </strong>portion: a writing journal or commentary. It should also be a minimum of three pages long for the final version. Explain the stages of your project: first, the choice of story or character, next, the problems and reflections you had while rewriting, including all the ideas you came up with and rejected and the reasons why. Some of the other ideas may lead to other projects later and it is good to have a record of them. Finally, include what you learned about your author and text and the process of writing. For example, what did you notice about your author's style when you read the story for class? What did you notice for the first time during or after class? How did your observation or appreciation of his/her style change as you worked on imitating it? For specifics, be sure to mention the criteria listed <a href="222ImitateStyle.html">here</a>.  The writing journal portion of this paper  is one of the rare occasions in a college paper where it is appropriate to use &quot;I,&quot; as you recount your experience as a writer. </p>
<p>In other words, your <em>rewrite</em> is your <strong>response</strong> to a text. Your <em>commentary</em> is the <strong>reflection</strong> on that response. For the peer review draft, you should include a page of your rewriting and a page of commentary, perhaps an outline. You will not have a thesis, per se, but you should have a <strong>very clear story idea or premise for alternative art project</strong>. Date entries in your writer's journal. Each time you get new input, such as your peer reviews and your instructor review,  revise your creative section, and add to the journal section to reflect the new issues raised by the reviewers. </p>
<p>You can  read the stories written by students in previous semesters <a href="222CreativeWriting.htm">here</a>. An amazing example which includes the majority of characters studied in FL 222 is <em><a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~dsbeckma/To Hell with Literature.htm">To Hell With Literature</a></em>(Joey Schopper, Fall 2006).</p>
<p>Need a name for a character in your creative story? To get the nationality right, check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_given_names">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_given_names</a></p>
<p><strong>B. Compare and contrast</strong> at least 2 texts from 2 different authors, including one 
  from the second half of the semester. <span class="red">Use the following comments as a <strong>guide</strong> to develop <strong>your own thesis</strong>. You do not need to answer all of them; you <strong>do</strong> need to have a coherent thesis.  Reminder: an thesis is not a topic, fact or opinion. It is an argument.</span> You may also choose your own topic. (See D below.)</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>The Function of Setting in</strong>&#133; (Tolstoy, Woolf, Kafka, Joyce, Brecht, 
    Camus&#133;)
    Discuss how the setting in these texts contributes to the main theme. Include 
    such issues as the history, particular location, spatial relations and the meaning 
    of movement from one space to another, the social meaning of space and place, 
    etc.</li>
  <li><strong> Illness, Disease and Death in</strong>&#133; (Flaubert, Tolstoy, Joyce, Mann, 
    Kafka&#133;) Describe how the authors represent illness, disease, and death, 
    and how these themes function in the texts. Pay attention to the societal aspects 
    of disease and death. Recommended reading&mdash;two articles  related to what I call <a href="222Isolationandcontact.html">The Gerasim Effect</a>&mdash;<em>The United States holds tens of thousands of inmates in long-term solitary confinement. Is this torture?</em> by Atul Gawande  and <em>Comforter and Comforted in an Unfolding Mystery</em> by Nell Burger Kirst. </li>
  <li><strong> The representation of gender roles in</strong>&#133;What positions do men and women occupy in society? What is expected of them because of their gender? What limitations does their gender impose? How does it shape romantic love? What are the differences between married love and romantic love that are portrayed? You may end with a comparison to contemporary gender roles.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>C. Text and Film/ Theater</strong>. See a filmed version of one of the texts we have read 
  in class or attend one of the plays performed locally this semester. Films can be viewed online or at DH Hill (see <a href="https://reserves.lib.ncsu.edu/"> reserve</a> holdings for our class). Write an analysis comparing the two&#151;consider how reading 
  and watching film are different. For example, <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span>, &quot;The Dead,&quot; &quot;The Lady with a Dog,&quot; &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest,&quot; and <span class="text">Death in Venice</span> have all been made into films. Your thesis should focus your evaluation of how the filmed version relates to the text version. Is it a successful, weak or failed adaptation? Is it a respectful hommage? A brilliant or flawed reworking of the original? </p>
<p> Here are some questions to think about: </p>
<ul>
  <li>What scenes were left out and what scenes were added? How did these changes 
    improve or detract from the story? You might want to concentrate on one element 
    or even one scene, such as the ending.</li>
  <li>How would you rate the director and the 
    choice of cast? Did the actors who played the roles in the film conform to your 
    expectations?</li>
  <li>How does the use of language, or the way certain actors behave, 
    imply a whole range of characteristics described in words in the book?</li>
  <li>Did the 
    director set the right tone for the film?</li>
  <li>How is seeing a play performed different than reading it?</li>
</ul>
<p>See &quot;Getting Ideas for Writing about a Film Based on a Work of Literature&quot; (176-78) or &quot;Getting Ideas for Writing about a Film Based on a Play&quot; (216-20) in <span class="text"> A Short Guide</span>.</p>
<p>If you are using a novel that has been remade into film several times, you might 
  want to consider the same scene in more than one version and think about time-related 
  choices. For instance, <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> has been remade in almost every decade 
  of the 20th century, incuding versions by Jean Renoir in 1933, Vincent Minnelli in 1949, and Claude Chabrol in 1991.  The emphasis in the films is different in part because 
  each reflects its own time and the ideas of its director.</p>
<p>See <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> (339) to cite a film or DVD. A useful site to find important quotes from movies: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Search/quotes">http://www.imdb.com/Search/quotes</a>. It is also often useful to listen to the director's commentary, if you are using a DVD with this feature.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> You may also propose <strong>your own topic</strong> as long as it is a <strong>comparison</strong>.  Your proposed topic must be submitted 
  to me for approval by the date of the peer review.</p>
<p>Sample topics from previous semesters: Blake's &quot;London&quot; and Wordsworth's &quot;Composed on Westminster Bridge&quot;; Autumn poems by Keats, Baudelaire, Verlaine and Auden; Death-bed scenes in Dickinson's 465 &quot;I heard a Fly buzz&quot; or 712 &quot;Because I could not stop for Death,&quot; and Emma's death scene in <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> or Ivan's in <span class="text">The Death of Ivan Ilyich</span>; <span class="text">Candide</span> and <span class="text">Forrest Gump</span>; Utopias in <span class="text">Candide</span> and <span class="text">The Village</span>; <span class="text">Wedding Crashers</span> and <span class="text">The Importance of Being Earnest</span>; <span class="text">Slumdog Millionaire</span> and <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> or <span class="text">Candide</span>; &quot;A Room of One's Own&quot; and Michael Cunningham's <span class="text"> The Hours;</span> <em>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</em> and Abrom's <span class="text">Tuesdays with Morrie</span>; <a href="222ASG14.html">Paintings and Poems</a>&hellip; The list goes on&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="red">Alert: Class will be meeting at IHOP (International House of Pancakes) on Hillsborough Street today!</span> I will be taking roll and collecting homework.  You'll also be discussing your answers to the following  questions, and some that I pass out at IHOP from chapter 3, and submitting a group report.<br />
  <br />
  Writing Assignment:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Who is Judith Shakespeare? Why does Woolf create her? What is the message about women and women writers that Woolf suggests by telling Judith's story? Is Judith fact, fiction, truth, a lie?</li>
  <li> Choose any work we've read so far and speculate about how it might have been different if the work had been written by a woman rather than a man. (There is no right or wrong answer: let your imagination take you somewhere. Would the characters be different? The plot? The ending? How does the author's gender impact his or her art?) </li>
  <li>Watch this eleven-minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4UWxlVvT1A">video</a> by French director Eleonore Pourriat. What is your reaction? What issues does is share with <em>A Room of One's Own</em>? How do you think Virginia Woolf might react to it if she could see  it? </li> </ol>

<h2><span class="class">Class 37 (Eliot and the Surrealists)</span><span class="date"> due Friday, November 20</span></h2>
    <p>Choose a poem from today's <a href="222EliotSurrealists.pdf">reading assignment</a> to write about: &quot;The Hollow Men,&quot; &quot;Dadaist Disgust,&quot; &quot;Proclamation without Pretension,&quot; or &quot;Free Union.&quot; Answer Shannon's 4 questions. Note important images, poetic devices, and modernist elements. What does the poem defamiliarize or do that is unexpected? Write a sentence or two about what you think the poem means. You do not need to bring your Norton Anthology, since the poems are not in there, but in the <a href="222EliotSurrealists.pdf">pdf</a> linked here and on the syllabus. It would be good to have copies of the poems with you, either as hard copies or on your computer/device. Be sure to bring a blank piece of notebook paper to class today as well.</p>

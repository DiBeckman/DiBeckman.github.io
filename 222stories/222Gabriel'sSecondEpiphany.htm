<p align="center">Gabriel&rsquo;s Second Epiphany</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gabriel awoke from the uncomfortable warmth of the thick, plush sheets that restrained him in the hotel bed.&nbsp; He looked bemusedly at his sleeping wife while he softly brushed the hair from her eyes with his fingertips.&nbsp; As he did so he began to remember the events from the night before and quietly rose from the bed leaving her side and walked slowly over to the window.&nbsp; The snow had stopped falling and dim, yellow light was shining into the shadowy room from the rising sun.&nbsp; Gabriel gazed paralyzed from the sight of the great white landscape that lay before him.&nbsp; Moments later he placed his warm cheek on the cool glass of the window trying to sort out his multifarious feelings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Gabriel arrived at the house, he was confronted with warm laughter and the smell of fresh paint from the newly painted hunter green walls in the hallway.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was considerably younger but still had the restless eyes covered by the gilt rimmed glasses he wore today.&nbsp; A friend of Gretta&rsquo;s had invited her to an evening gathering on one particularly cool spring night; the same gathering Gabriel was attending.&nbsp; Gabriel first caught sight of Gretta as she was gracefully hanging up her simple but sensible coat on the mahogany hooks in the hostess&rsquo;s foyer.&nbsp; She noticed him eyeing her and gave him a friendly smile.&nbsp; This smile sent a wave of intensity through Gabriel who instantly felt the desire to speak with this woman.&nbsp; When he regained his will to talk he called out to her but she had already left the room to join the rest of the party.&nbsp; The guests sat down as dinner plates full of steaming corned beef, potatoes and cooked cabbage were being set in front of each place.&nbsp; Gabriel and Gretta sat at adjacent ends of the large table where he allowed himself to look at her through the corner of his eye, which subtly moved over her refined hands, slim arms, and inviting red lips.&nbsp; As usual his friends solicited him until he agreed to tell the story about his foolish professor from his second year at The Royal University that they amazingly still found funny after so many retellings.&nbsp; When he had finished the story he heard a sincere but quiet laugh escape Gretta&rsquo;s mouth, and was given a feeling of satisfaction.&nbsp; By the time everyone had cleared their plates he had engaged in an affable conversation with Gretta.&nbsp; He guided her to the porch where she hesitantly followed.&nbsp; Outside on the porch Gabriel noticed how the gray clouds overhead were subtly lit by the moon set high in the black night sky.&nbsp; This same light illuminated Gretta&rsquo;s graceful features in a mysterious way.&nbsp; As everyone was saying their goodbyes and preparing to leave Gabriel slipped Gretta&rsquo;s coat over her small shoulders and asked her if she would accompany him to dinner one night.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Gabriel remembered watching as she neared the exit without giving him an answer.&nbsp; She stepped outside though the open door and turned her head to look at Gabriel before she left with an air of regret told him her answer.&nbsp; With a smile Gabriel recalled how she had told him no on that cool spring night of their first meeting.&nbsp; It was not until a few weeks later when they met again at a party that she finally agreed to let him take her out.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window no longer chilled his cheek and the room was almost completely filled with sunlight.&nbsp; He carried his thoughts over to the chair, which had not yet been touched with light.&nbsp; The petticoat that had been flung on it the night before now had fallen onto the floor in a heap.&nbsp; Gabriel collected Gretta&rsquo;s clothes from the floor and placed them on the corner of the bed she was still deeply asleep on.&nbsp; He followed the diamond shaped pattern on the mauve colored carpet back to the cushioned chair and with a muted squeak sat down and allowed his head to fall over the back of the chair resting his neck on its edge.&nbsp; After a few moments he raised his head again only to stare perplexedly into space.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why was it that in the past night only memories of intimacy were resurfacing into his thoughts? For the first time Gabriel boldly questioned whether he was wrong to want to remember only these moments and to forget the dull ones?&nbsp; The heliotrope envelope, the crowed platform, and the foyer where he watched her take her coat off for the first time was fresh in Gabriel&rsquo;s head and filled up the empty space he was staring into.&nbsp; As the light from the window crept slowly past Gabriel&rsquo;s feet, slightly warming his toes, he began to think about all the moments in his and Gretta&rsquo;s relationship that he had let slip to the dark recesses of his conscious. He noticed that her single boot that had reminded upright the night before had now fallen onto its side and inched his own foot over its smooth surface. A distant memory of Gretta dressing their once infant son and struggling to put a pair of tiny of blue shoes on his feet, materialized in his mind.&nbsp; He remembered watching this scene and after giving a lighthearted chuckle, holding the little boy&rsquo;s pink wiggly feet still so she could get the shoes on him.&nbsp; The light had become more intense and now inched up onto his legs.&nbsp; As he sat up, he took off his glasses and cleaned them with a corner of his shirt, then proceeded to rest his arms on his knees allowing his upper body to soak in the light&rsquo;s warmth.&nbsp; These memories no matter how banal made up his and Gretta&rsquo;s life together. Yes, together.&nbsp; Gretta through good times and bad had stayed by his side, she was the mother of his children, she was his wife and she was part of his identity, which he now no longer considered impalpable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though Michael Furey held a piece of Gretta&rsquo;s heart, Gabriel had come to believe he held the rest of it with the life they had shared thus far.&nbsp; He loved his wife, he was a loyal husband and now appreciated the life they lived as a couple even the extended moments of everyday routine, and he believed that this was just as honorable as Michael Furey&rsquo;s passionate death.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the corner in his chair, Gabriel saw Gretta awaken and sit up against the bed&rsquo;s oak headboard.&nbsp; A beam of light shown across her rosy cheeks making her look more alive than ever.&nbsp; She looked at the empty space in the bed beside her and let her eyes travel around the room until they found Gabriel. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Come lay with me Gabriel for just a little while longer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without a word Gabriel rose from his chair and glanced out through the window.&nbsp;&nbsp; A world full of life now greeted him filling his soul with joy.&nbsp; Gabriel gracefully inched his way over to Gretta&rsquo;s side and embraced her with a passionate kiss that she willingly returned.&nbsp; </p>
<p>On the ride back to Monkstown Gabriel&rsquo;s mind was peppered with thoughts of his and Gretta&rsquo;s future together in Ireland, which amalgamated with thoughts of going to the continent.&nbsp; This could be the vital change in their lives that he desperately needed.&nbsp; When they returned home he would finally suggest to Gretta that they make the permanent move to Europe, which until now never had the courage to make.</p>

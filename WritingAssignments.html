Due date: Sept. 11, 2003<br>
Goals <br>
- learn to annotate a text <br>
- describe some of the imagery and reflect about its meaning or function in a 
poem <br>
- summarize ideas discussed in a short textual passage <br>
- share the highlights of your analysis to the class in a brief (5-8 minute) presentation<br>
This project may be done individually or with a partner.<br>
Assignment <br>
a. Make a copy of the poem you will present. Read chapter 2 of Shannon. Then read, 
re-read, and annotate the poem as described in Shannon&#146;s chapter 2 , with 
hand-written comments. <br>
b. Type a few notes (about 1/2 page to 1 page) that contain the following: 1. 
your observations about some of the imagery; 2. a few sentences that the meaning 
of the poem. Since these are &#147;notes,&#148; you don&#146;t need to write an 
introduction or conclusion or make an argument. Just observe, describe, summarize. 
<br>
c. Prepare to present the poem and the highlights of your observations to the 
class.<br>
Evaluation <br>
For the written work, I will be looking at: your thoughtful annotations on the 
copied pages; your ability to detect and describe the metaphors (imagery) used 
in the text and your thoughts about why the writer may have used this imagery; 
how well you are able to summarize, in just a few sentences, some of the main 
ideas or the meaning of the poem. <br>
For the presentation, I will be looking at the qualities identified in the Assessment 
Guide for Oral Presentations.<br>
Paper 1<br>
Due Dates:<br>
Paper 1 draft to class for peer review Sept. 25, 2003<br>
Paper 1 draft to professor Oct. 2, 2003<br>
Paper 1 final draft Oct. 16, 2003<br>
Goals <br>
- learn to effectively use the process of outlining, writing a draft, polishing 
the final product <br>
- learn to provide constructive feedback in the peer review process <br>
- learn to compare the representation of a topic in two literary works <br>
- learn to write a subjective literary analysis of 2-3 pages (upper limit: 4 pages) 
<br>
Steps for writing Paper 1<br>
- Step 1: read, re-read and annotate your texts; write a one page outline for 
your paper, following your preferred outline style (see Shannon, Chapter 4); include 
a fully formulated thesis. <br>
- Step 2: read Shannon chapter 5, pp. 100 &#150; 132; write a first draft of 1-2 
pages about one of the topics below, for the peer review session; it should have 
a working title and a fully formulated introduction (you can rewrite them later, 
but they need to be there for the draft) and several finished paragraphs; your 
audience knows the text, so you should avoid plot summaries. This is the draft 
version of paper 1; print and bring 3 copies of it to class. <br>
- Paper 1: read Shannon chapter 5, pp. 132 &#150; 163; produce the final version: 
revise, rewrite, amend and polish your draft based on the peer and professor&#146;s 
review feedback and Shannon&#146;s suggestions; add material if you need more 
length, but also trim unnecessary verbiage; check Course Information for a general 
description of the paper assignments and details on type font, margins, etc.<br>
Hand in the final version together with all required supporting documents: 1) 
a typed first draft; 2) peer and instructor&#146;s review and evidence that you 
have addressed these comments, 3) a self- evaluation including a reflective statement, 
and 4) a final draft reflecting all previous work.<br>
Topics for Paper 1<br>
Choose two of the following works compare them: Voltaire&#146;s Candide, Pushkin&#146;s 
Queen of Spades, Flaubert&#146;s Madame Bovary, Tolstoy&#146;s The Death of Ivan 
Ilyich, and Ibsen&#146;s Hedda Gabler.<br>
1. The representation of gender roles in . . . What positions do men and women 
occupy in society? What is expected of them because of their gender? What limitations 
does their gender impose? How does it shape romantic love? You may end with a 
comparison to contemporary gender roles.<br>
2. The motif of the quest in. . . What are the protagonists seeking? How do they 
go about achieving their goals? Are there sacrifices, pitfalls, a price to pay?

3. Social criticism in . . . What conventions, events, developments or institutions 
do the authors criticize? Which literary devices do the authors use to express 
their criticism? Are there parallels to contemporary social problems?<br>
4. Borders and boundaries in . . .What social (interpersonal, class. . .) or spatial 
(architectural, geographical&#133;) boundaries are portrayed in the text? How 
do they affect the characters and events in the stories? What happens when the 
borders or boundaries are crossed? Do borders and boundaries support society?<br>
5. You may also propose your own topic, such as an analysis of 2 poems or a comparison 
including other works in the first two sections of the Anthology. Your proposed 
topic must be submitted to me for approval by Sept. 23. <br>

mechanics; also to Paper 1. <br>
- write the first draft of 2-3 pages (could be the first 2 pages, or a short version 
of your paper) and bring 3 copies to class. <br>
You are not required to use secondary sources (books, articles, internet) for 
this paper, but if you do, be sure to quote and document them properly and attach 
a &#147;Works Cited&#148; page. Plagiarism is a poor choice and will not be tolerated; 
see Shannon pp. 148-150 about this issue and consult your syllabus about the NC 
State academic integrity policy; ask your instructor if questions remain. For 
information on using research (if you do) and writing the documentation page, 
consult Shannon chapter 6 (pp. 164 &#150; 196). <br>
Final version: <br>
- address the comments from your teacher and peers to improve your paper <br>
- develop your paper to 4-5 pages <br>
- write a good conclusion <br>
- check if your introduction and the thesis still work after you have completed 
the paper; rewrite or modify them if this is not the case! <br>
Topics for Paper 2 <br>
Compare and contrast at least 2 texts from 2 different authors, including one 
from the second half of the semester. <br>
1. The Function of Setting in ... (Proust, Woolf, Kafka, Joyce, Camus...) <br>
Discuss how the setting in these texts contributes to the main theme. Include 
such issues as the history, particular location, spatial relations and the meaning 
of movement from one space to another, the social meaning of space and place, 
etc. <br>
2. Illness, Disease and Death in&#133; (Flaubert, Tolstoy, Joyce, Kafka&#133;) 
Describe how the authors represent illness, disease, and death, and how these 
themes function in the texts. Pay attention to the societal aspects of disease 
and death.<br>
3. Modernist Representations of the Inner Life in &#133; (Proust, Woolf, Kafka&#133;). 
Analyze how these authors describe different states of mind, thoughts, emotions, 
desires, etc. Also describe which narrative styles these authors use to convey 
the inner life of their characters and how this shapes the form of their narratives.<br>
4. Text and Film. See a filmed version of one of the texts we have read in class. 
You can rent one at the video store or check one out of the Media Center at DH 
Hill. Write an analysis comparing the two&#151;consider how reading and watching 
film are different. Here are some questions to think about: <br>
What scenes were left out and what scenes were added? How did these changes improve 
or detract from the story? You might want to concentrate on one element or even 
one scene, such as the ending. How would you rate the director and the choice 
of cast? Did the actors who played the roles in the film conform to your expectations? 
How does the use of language, or the way certain actors behave, imply a whole 
range of characteristics described in words in the book? Did the director set 
the right tone for the film?<br>
If you are using a novel that has been remade into film several times, you might 
want to consider the same scene in more than one version and think about time-related 
choices. For instance, Madame Bovary has been remade in almost every decade of 
the 20th century. The emphasis in the films is different probably because they 
reflect their times and their directors.<br>
5. You may also propose your own topic, such as an analysis of poems, topics from 
Paper 1 or a comparison, as long as you include at least one work from the works 
we have read since the midterm. Your proposed topic must be submitted to me for 
approval by November 11. <br>
The paper will be evaluated using the SCORING RUBRIC FOR WRITTEN ESSAY IN UPPER-LEVEL

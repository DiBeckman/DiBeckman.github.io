<p align="center" class="style2">1)<em> All your Actual Fiction and Fictitious Actuality Needs is Encouragement</em><strong><br>
</strong>by Kate Fisher </p>
<p>I was walking down Westman Blvd all the while thinking. I was thinking a lot. I bet my brain consumed more calories than my body did on that stretch of road, and I walk fast, like a woman on a mission regardless if there is a mission. Why do I walk so fast? Maybe it is out of habit. It&rsquo;s as if I am chopping butter with my arms with every step. I always make good time to my classes with 10 minutes to spare. At least 10 minutes, always. Anyway, so I was thinking, as I was walking, about the prompt I was given to speak about in my communications class next week: Women and Fiction.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s almost like a newspaper article title: Women and Fiction. Newspaper titles seem to be so abrupt and misleading; they hardly clue you in to the actual content of the article. They contain forced puns, and words that can be both nouns and verbs. For example, what is one to make of the title: Fish Bikes out of Water. &ldquo;Fish&rdquo; and &ldquo;bikes&rdquo; are both noun-verbs. Is this about a man named Fish in a triathlon? Is this an environmentalists&rsquo; cry to promote lake clean up after improper disposal of athletic equipment? Is this coverage on a local&rsquo;s appearance on David Letterman&rsquo;s &lsquo;stupid pet tricks&rsquo;? Is Fish Bikes a proper noun and does &ldquo;Fish Bikes&rdquo; need water? To top it off one can spot a horribly executed, half-assed pun. I am as frustrated with this title as I am with the title of my speech: Women and Fiction. Do I talk about how women are presented in fiction? Do I talk about famous women <em>in </em>fiction? Do I talk about women writers? How women react to fiction? Which type of fiction do I&hellip;</p>
<p>A steady stream of cars rolls by creating a hum for my thoughts to travel with on this road. Then, a honk. My immediate reaction when this happens is to poke my head out of my thoughts and try to steal a glimpse at what I might have missed that warranted a honk, though a nanosecond into my investigation I know clear well what spurred the honk. There was no intersection, and no nearby traffic violator, both of which are usually prerequisites of honks. This wasn&rsquo;t a honk of punishment or warning. No, this was a honk of recognition; a man was paying tribute to a young female. I try not to blush, and I look down and act as if unaware of the car that&rsquo;s by now long gone. I can&rsquo;t help but be a little impressed with myself; I&rsquo;m chopping butter with my arms and wearing a baggy shirt, and I&rsquo;m <em>still </em>worthy of a short lay on the horn. Short little jab on the steering wheel. It&rsquo;s funny how the duration of the action can turn a normal activity into one used for courting. For example: the handshake. If a guy lingers his hand in yours for two seconds longer than the standard duration, consider yourself hit on. If it was just two seconds shorter it could have been considered proper protocol. If a guy jabs at his steering wheel as if trying to kill a potentially messy bug with his unprotected hands, you can consider the series of short sounds emitted as his way of saying, &ldquo;you are hot&rdquo;. If it was one, elongated honk, then it was probably aimed at someone who almost caused or is about to almost cause a wreck, which is the proper horn usage.&nbsp; As you can see, I was back to thinking. The horn merely redirected my thoughts.&nbsp; Back to where I started: my speech.&nbsp; So, I needed to determine the angle at which I would aim my speech. Being a woman myself, I thought I would start with my own experiences as my first reference; I didn&rsquo;t have time to go to the library, anyway. I searched through the catalogues of my brain for any memories related to the topic. Automatically, I recalled that <em>I</em> actually wanted to be a writer. Those aspirations were shot out of my head early during my first year at college. &ldquo;Oh writing is good and amusing, but how is that helping anyone?&rdquo; These were words from my dad&rsquo;s brain, which he would type in an AIM conversation, that would resonate inside my head, and solidify my path towards completing an engineering degree. This quote is an awful way to introduce my dad. Contrary to your assumption, he is more of a lighthouse than a leash. When I expressed interest in something he would come home the next day bearing magazines related to that topic, encouraging me to explore. Once, he even bought me magazines with tattoo designs, because I told him I wanted to be a tattoo artist, despite the common conception that children&rsquo;s interest in tattoos should be startling to and terminated by parents. If I said I was interested in cigarettes he would probably buy me tobacco-curing manuals. He was an involved parent.&nbsp; When he dissuaded me from pursuing whatever major that writers usually completed (if there is one), he was just looking out for me, and didn&rsquo;t want me to be waiting tables for the rest of my life as I try to &ldquo;make it&rdquo; as a social satirist or fiction writer. He just wanted to protect his daughter, like any good father. He cleverly appealed to the humanitarian side of me, by asking &ldquo;how does that help anyone?&rdquo; He knew my original plan was to save the environment when I came to college, and used this fact in his fight to refocus my goals. So I became a bit discouraged, and I knew I was not a writer. This wasn&rsquo;t big news to me. I never thought I could become a writer, anyway. I grew up believing that writers were born with special skills that no one else possessed. A writer was born, not inspired then developed. Some people were writers, and I was not. I didn&rsquo;t think anyone I knew could be a writer either. Writers were mysterious people who live in high-tech apartments in congested areas or in spacious cottages in isolated areas. Either way, <em>I</em> was never going to be one, nor come into contact with one.</p>
<p>Reflecting on that memory, which triggered my conceptions of writers, sparked an epiphany. I realized that we are all writers in some way. You can be a writer <em>and </em>something else. Think about your role in your family. I am both a daughter and a sister. Why pretend that you can only have one position? We all have the potential to write fiction. Everyone makes connections in their brain all the time. When I look at a wine opener, I see the figure of &ldquo;ET&rdquo;. When I step on my accelerator softly, I envision myself heating a bag of crickets, as the chirping becomes progressively, yet almost imperceptibly louder. When you read this essay you notice it is all metaphors, similes, and analogies all spread about and tucked one within another, like walking into a store that sells those Russian nested dolls.&nbsp; Is this fiction since it has so much imagery? They are my own actual fictitious thoughts, though. The line between fiction and nonfiction has been blurred beyond salvage. The line between being a class assignment and work of fiction has also been blurred. So this is what I concluded on my walk: all that women need to become fiction writers is encouragement.&nbsp; </p>

  2 ) <em>My Dearest Emma</em><br>
by Kinsey Brooks</p>
<p> My Dearest Emma,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have become quite worried about you since you last wrote to me a few months ago.&nbsp; Your letters have gotten fewer and farther in between, and one might wonder what exactly is going through your troubled little head.&nbsp; Getting married to the first commoner you can charm into thinking you are adorable&mdash;how smashing!&nbsp; But it is not important, I suppose, because it is to my great misfortune that it is the duty of today&rsquo;s woman to find a suitable husband, and no doubt Charles Bovary is quite suitable for the likes of you.&nbsp; And I am quite sure that there is nothing I can do or say that will change your mind, but please, my dear, I do implore you to hear me out, as it were.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your growing dependencies on men are quite alarming.&nbsp; I can understand how frustrating it must be to live with your father and the cows and the chickens, and I also understand why you long for a life less provincial and more exciting and romantic.&nbsp; But why, I ask you, does that mean that you jump at the first chance you ever get to become married?&nbsp; Where is the romance in a marriage spawned from cunning and opportunity?&nbsp; Surely you cannot be interested in life with that country &ldquo;doctor&rdquo;; he is hardly fit to apply a proper dressing on a child&rsquo;s scratched knee!&nbsp; Charles Bovary?&nbsp; Charles Bovary?!&nbsp; I suppose at the very least he could provide a nice salary off of which the two of you could live comfortably, but do you not want more from your marriage, or even more from your own life?&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t there more to living than just having a husband, bearing his children, making a hot meal for him when he comes home late at night, and spending all of his money?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps I am losing my temper with you.&nbsp; I simply do not want to see you make a terrible, horrible mistake.&nbsp; I consider myself extremely fortunate that I do not have to marry at all, due to the allowance left to me by my aunt in her will.&nbsp; I suppose, had her unfortunate end not turned out in my favor, I would have already been married to some man my family deemed appropriate.&nbsp; It is a shame because I would never have had a say in how my own life would have turned out, but now, I can write as much as I want and live a modest but definitely comfortable life.&nbsp; But is that really important in the grand scheme of things?&nbsp; If you are happy with Charles, then that is all that matters, but you must be sure that you are really, truly happy.&nbsp; Marriage is not to be entered into lightly.&nbsp; If this were a perfect world women would not need to get married because men would see us as their equals in every way, and they would not be afraid to say so.&nbsp; But this is only my little dream world where women can support themselves all on their own and follow their dreams without fear of being persecuted by those who are frightened by the prospect of a woman taking care of herself all on her own.&nbsp; Why should either of us care what an arbitrary rule-making man thinks is proper?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please do not be offended by the frankness of my letter to you, dear friend, but I am so concerned with your well-being.&nbsp; I do wish that you would take my advice to heart; I have your interests in mind, I promise that with the utmost sincerity.&nbsp; Please, do write back.&nbsp; I am keenly interested to know how this all turns out, marriage or no marriage.&nbsp; I wish you the best either way.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Mary Beton Seton Carmichael</p>

<p align="center"><span class="style2">3. <em>An Unwritten Novel in Venice</em></span><br>
  <span class="style2">by BJ Ward </span></p>
<p><br>
  <em>This story is told in the style of Virginia Woolf&rsquo;s &quot;An Unwritten Novel&quot;, and is set in &quot;Death in Venice&quot;, the short story by Thomas Mann.  In this scene, Mann is sitting across from a man he thinks is his character Aschenbach as he attempts to escape from the plague-ridden city of Venice.</em></p>
<p>Such an expression of unhappiness was enough by itself to make one&rsquo;s eyes slide above the paper&rsquo;s edge to the poor man&rsquo;s face &ndash; composed except for the despair in his eyes, which stared from his rigid continence an embodiment of conflicted regret, a black pit of sorrow with a feverish glaze.  Five faces sat opposite me &ndash; four pairs of lips shut tight, dark eyebrows furrowed &ndash; they intently ignored the suffering man&rsquo;s eyes, everyone&rsquo;s eyes, with papers and paperback novels.  A nest of print to insulate from reality, from pain.    The fifth face had no insulation save his stern mask of composure.  He stared out of it with eyes uncovered.  Ah, but my poor unfortunate brother, do play the game!  Do, for all our sakes conceal the darkness from your eyes.<br>
  He looked up from his examination of the void, looked into my eyes as if to say, &ldquo;God hope you never have to know what I know.&rdquo;  Oh, but it was too late!  One by one, the other four faces disembark, disappear.  We were alone on the deck of the steamer.  He addressed me, we traded talk in bland banalities.  Weather, holidays, grown daughters and the German economy.  The distress in his eyes never faltered during the exceedingly colorless conversation.  His lips were red, from nervous biting, like rouge scrubbed hastily, furiously from them but wasn&rsquo;t totally gone.  During our fa&ccedil;ade of trivial chatter, the mask on the face would crack for a split second.  His mouth would move quickly, convulsively, desperately, the lips puckering into a silent uuu.  Hands clenched and unclenched at his sides.  We slid past San Marco up the Grand Canal, and the sorrow welled up behind his mask right in the middle of a statement about the earliness of the impending summer.  Lips pursed like a desperate, reaching kiss unleashed a moan that sounded like &ldquo;Tadziuuu&rdquo;.  He stopped silent and white, eyes boring into the water and the pigeons on the byzantine roofs and I knew him suddenly completely, inside of his eyes.  I knew of the conflict and the haze of horrid sadness. <br>
  <br>
  &ldquo;Tadzio&rdquo;, I prompted &ndash; <br>
  His lips remained in their red unfulfilled kiss.  I understood.  What was in his eyes was a reaction to that monotony of life, that horror that threatens to consume us all.  A fanciful escape.  A lover.  An unwinding from a rigid, cold, loveless life.  He had passed along his secret, his poison in that glance.  We were finished talking, but as I looked out over the rocking water I could see it all unfold before me.  A watery day in Munich, gray and damp like days and decades before it, had started it.  A spartan apartment, a little light seeping from the lamp on an orderly desk with three sharp metal fountain pens in a row, an aluminum bed stand in a corner, gray wool blanket creased with painful precision.  A walk, an escape down Prinzregenstrasse &ndash; rain implied even in the name.  There goes Aschenbach, all work, that one.  He&rsquo;s a steel coil in a steel box under closely scrutinized lock and key.  His fists, spasms, open fans on the wooden bench beside him.  We passed the public gardens &ndash; red sickly grape vines draped limply over railings, the tropic breath of the sirocco too much for their temperate nature, and I knew you and saw inside your eyes.<br>
  <br>
  In the cemetery where it all began, an unnaturally warm breeze caressed headstones, billowed through crevices, around altars, between Greek crosses.  A traveler came on the breeze, not quite a whole man with red lashes, liplessly leering.  If I were you, Aschenbach, I would have run from him, but who is strong enough to run from destiny?  It was calling to you&hellip;an enduring restless compulsion, a gnawing infection &ndash; the traveler&rsquo;s iron-tipped walking stick pounding your fate into the dirt floor of the tomb.  You would go.  Of course you would have to go, but not quite to the tigers.<br>
  You saw yourself in a fop&rsquo;s eyes and you were frightened and dismayed.  Reeking perfume and brightly banded hat.  You did not know until much later - what you hated was seeing yourself looking back reflected in the alcoholic glaze of his eyes.  Youth, beauty, fresh innocence torn from you by the cruelty of years &ndash; it is no use pretending.  Your respectable tweed fa&ccedil;ade would vanish in an instant if temptation glistened nearby.  Oh what a tentative hold!  Our compliments to your beloved, your dearly beloved, your lovely beloved.  Tadziuuu.  The mask was cracking, composure crumbling like brittle egg shells.  Again the lips mouthed their silent kiss and we passed the Piazzetta, revealed in its princely splendor in the yellow light. <br>
  And here it comes, I knew I&rsquo;d find him in you, behind your most barricaded walls next to your flushed pulsing heart.  There are his chaste sisters in gray collars, his fussy maid with her flurry of French, the imposing bejeweled Polish mother, we&rsquo;ll push past them.  And there at last he is at the focal point blonde curls cherished like honey and gold to be left as offerings in a pharaoh&rsquo;s tomb.  Oh how you yearn for that statue of perfection!  To be ever closer to translucent delicacy of marble skin blue veined and sublime &ndash; a sailor&rsquo;s collar, an opulent silk bow &ndash; you hide behind your newspaper behind the fern just as I hide now to better observe your inner pain, the longing behind the pain, Tadzio on his pedestal.  The steamer is passing under the magnificent marble arch of the Rialto and you&rsquo;re still wrestling behind your mask of composure and cracked powder and rouge.  You were so close!  To get any closer would surely unleash a galloping wave of sin &ndash; wrongness &ndash; Dionysus would approve the holiest of unions.  Mentor and student fuse into one burst of sublime inspiration!  Beauty!  Truth!  The tangle of golden halo swallows and fills the yawning void with meaning with succulent abandon with wholeness in taboo.  The boy would not live long. <br>
  <br>
  Are you listening, Aschenbach?  We were approaching the railway station &ndash; tightlipped faces flashing by, we pulled into the dock.  Get out while you can &ndash; the conflicted misery in your eyes in your soul is a contrived infection &ndash; you will not live long &ndash; he will stand in the putrid water in the smooth water in the infinite water and beckon you, honey skin glistening, sunset glowing through his curls, red eyebrows, adam&rsquo;s apple protruding, rictus lipless furrowed he will call you.  And you will come to him, succumb to him if you do not master yourself now.  Do not go back or you will not live long!  The tigers will be waiting with their fever and their hot breath and teeth behind ferns.  Go back for him and the void will take you whole!  Courage, courage!  Face it, take it, withstand!  For God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t go back now!  There&rsquo;s the gangplank!   I&rsquo;m on your side.  Get on that train and never think of him again!<br>
  &ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon!  Yes, this is the Santa Lucia station.  I&rsquo;ll hand it down for you.  Oh, it&rsquo;s not yours.&rdquo;  [But Aschenbach, although we uphold the fa&ccedil;ade, I&rsquo;ve known your fears and secrets, I&rsquo;ve been inside your head &ndash; I&rsquo;m with you now.] <br>
  <br>
  &ldquo;You have no luggage?&rdquo;<br>
  <br>
  &ldquo;I am only here to meet my family.  Good day.&rdquo;<br>
  <br>
  (Very well, keep up your fa&ccedil;ade, but why do you hesitate!?  NO!  Get to your platform!  Who are you waiting for, he would not follow you here, Tadzio will be on the beach, your daughter is in gray Munich walking her German Shepherd next to the lake.)<br>
  <br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for them, sir, thank you.  No, they said they&rsquo;d meet me presently; their train is early&hellip;Oh!  There they are!  That&rsquo;s my wife and son.&rdquo;<br>
  <br>
  So they walk off into the setting sun together, son on his shoulders, wife on his arm, bags pulled carelessly behind.  Something is wrong.  Look how they laugh, it&rsquo;s untrue!  For sure it&rsquo;s all false.  Who am I?  My life is blank and coarse as drought.  He flags a gondola shining in the sun.  What&rsquo;s the joke?  Off they go back into the heart of the floating city.  Not Aschenbach, but a different man, a different life.  No matter.  Aschenbach is alive somewhere, more alive than this false Aschenbach.  And I adore you; it&rsquo;s you I embrace, and your story I will tell!</p>

  4. <em>An Unwritten [something] of One&rsquo;s Own</em><br>
Robert El-Jaouhari April 17, 2009</p>
<p align="left"><br>
  There, Virginia kneels where she ought stand &ndash; where indeed she does stand &ndash; exclaiming an adorable world. I think of her as standing; but in the event, she kneels. Must she &ndash; must I &ndash; kneel, play the ritual, profess the antics? If I open my arms, what do I embrace? There before an unknown altar: rituals, antics, exuberance...and not a trace &ndash; of what? Might I have said &ldquo;of reality&rdquo;? I might have &ndash; but I might also have knelt &ndash; I might also have stood &ndash; I might also have let you &ndash; let myself &ndash; alone. What do we make of this? What do I make of this? It&rsquo;s an expression of [something] for sure. How pleasant that the world might be so clear; how pleasant that when I look for your embrace &ndash; when I look for my embrace &ndash; I might kneel and rant...<br>
  <br>
  But if I stand &ndash; if I look to you, speak to you, tell you &ndash; Adorable World! &ndash; do you answer? How could you...do I answer...how could I... It&rsquo;s another walk in the catacombs, and I slipped; how simple a walk, that I might do something so simple as slip...<br>
  <br>
  You would tell me? I would tell me? Well of course, what have we to do but tell; aye, there&rsquo;s the rub &ndash; oops, here&rsquo;s the rub, there&rsquo;s the work, the blot the stain the mash the trouble the presence &ndash; the presence? of what? Well of the stain, the blot, what else? Sure sure, it needs laboring; and yet you don&rsquo;t, while I do &ndash; now wait, that means I don&rsquo;t while you do &ndash; frustrating, frustrating... Just if you could open yourself up...if I could open myself up...If I could open yourself up! No no no, one musn&rsquo;t say these things they sound so vulgar, misinterpretation and all; one might worry and we wouldn&rsquo;t want worry, would we? Would you? Would I? Ah- there&rsquo;s the rub, the blot, the stain, the mash the trouble the presence &ndash; where&rsquo;s that damned presence coming from...presence of what!<br>
  <br>
  of anything? <br>
  <br>
  -	What grounds this supposed presence? Surely whatever grounds all else...<br>
  It&rsquo;s nice how he twirls his whiskers when he says that, isn&rsquo;t it? Of course Plato has, of all the times and places and bodies in whatever, chosen that one &ndash; I&rsquo;ll be, he even acts it well. The world has waited for you sir, please please, don&rsquo;t let me interrupt... &ldquo;presence&rdquo; is such a general term, universal, limitless &ndash; infinite? &ndash; no, limitless... Yes sir, how lucky we are it should be limited, made finite, indeed trickling from your very lips, sir! Such little gems! How long you must have pressed the blackness, and with what force! Brava!<br>
  <br>
  Brava? What hath Freud wrought...another walk in the catacombs, and I slipped... Leave him, leave him, let&rsquo;s be back where we were...<br>
  <br>
  where&rsquo;s my &ndash; oop, your &ndash; foothold? Why not move? Well my feet are held...you&rsquo;re the floater, the uncertainty, the lostness but not quite the lost [my eyes here squint, I let my head drop forward just so, eyes yet straight ahead...the look provides emphasis, no? Well if it didn&rsquo;t &ndash; there was emphasis] &ndash; you&rsquo;re the lostness but not quite the lost &ndash; that is, not quite the lost one...and why not? Well, you&rsquo;d need presence. Oh that wretchedness again, running us straight from where we &ndash; where I &ndash; began...<br>
  <br>
  Where did we begin, after all? At the foothold &ndash; but your feet aren&rsquo;t held &ndash; wait now, that&rsquo;s not the way to ask it: better, where did I begin...<br>
  <br>
  Such an absurd question... Not to say it doesn&rsquo;t have an answer, but it seems at first to be outside my grasp &ndash; wait... [just as the thought comes so comes the disturbance...ugh, how pleasant were it to have slipped my grasp, my sieve of a hand; but to have it so taken from me, to have it run into hiding from a sidelong glance &ndash; a glance even! Whereto, my dear, there&rsquo;ll be no harm... I really ought not bother him with questions of beginnings, his, yours, mine, or ours].<br>
  <br>
  Wonderful &ndash; now that the thought&rsquo;s been broken, let&rsquo;s see if we &ndash; I &ndash; can begin again. But how to begin? Here&rsquo;s me, there&rsquo;s you, simple enough; now whereto? You&rsquo;re moving. Wait, not too far, not too far... Let&rsquo;s bring it back, bring it back, draw the string some, see what we have... &ldquo;Values in a Universe of Chance&rdquo; &ndash; a collection of writings of CS Peirce. Where does that put you? It puts me in
  front of a book, probably a classroom &ndash; &ldquo;How does Peirce feel about values? How does Peirce feel about values in a universe of chance?&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;How does Professor feel about a room without windows?&rdquo;<br>
  <br>
  -	How now? <br>
  <br>
  -	What? <br>
  <br>
  -	You were responding, I think?<br>
  <br>
  -	Oh no, no such thing &ndash; I was dying, that&rsquo;s all, dying... <br>
  <br>
  -	Oh? Lost our sense of value, have we? <br>
  <br>
  -	I don&rsquo;t know what we have lost; I wouldn&rsquo;t say I had lost anything &ndash; or gained anything &ndash; or &ndash; well I haven&rsquo;t a whisker to twirl, forget it all... <br>
  <br>
  -	Oh, no, no. I wasn&rsquo;t... [hand gestures] I wouldn&rsquo;t... [wave it away] no, go ahead, you were saying...&rdquo;<br>
  <br> 
  Really now, I was doing the saying. How do <em>I</em> feel about a room without windows? Where&rsquo;s my Adorable World?! &ndash; here, isn&rsquo;t it? Am&rsquo;n&rsquo;t I the footing? Make not I my own room? My own Adorable World? Superciliousness prevails in that case... and again without the proper...form? Sure sure, form, that&rsquo;ll do. I nod, resign myself to a loss &ndash; But of the word, not the world! No now, I&rsquo;ve still a world without a word, haven&rsquo;t I? Isn&rsquo;t it my own, my making, my... No, my Adorable World sets itself around me. Whatever I try, however I move, I am set. People move, nations move, eras move, epochs move, and should there have been windows they&rsquo;d have moved too &ndash; or have been moved. I can&rsquo;t put my finger &ndash; no; I can&rsquo;t put my tongue on it, that gelatinous <em>bon mot</em> that absorbs from each corner of my thought [in such a pleasantly roundabout way] and smacks itself &ndash; is smacked? &ndash; on the table before me, for your sake &ndash; for your sake? For my sake?<br>
  <br>
  Aye, there&rsquo;s the rub... Whether &lsquo;tis nobler to suffer one&rsquo;s own thought in one&rsquo;s own mind or suffer the slings and arrows of the properly clear expression... to speak or not to speak...what a miracle I could speak the question... to suffer, in any case: &ldquo;Literature is strewn with the wreckage of men who
  have minded beyond reason the opinions of others&rdquo; &ndash; V. Woolf. And on what grounds? Well, on every ground: no peace inside, no quiet outside, what&rsquo;s to be done with this folly of a dream for peace and quiet? &ldquo;We need only draw the curtain of words to behold the fairest tree of knowledge, whose fruit is excellent and within the reach of our hand&rdquo; &ndash; George Berkeley. &ldquo;We need only draw the fairest tree of knowledge to behold the curtain of words, whose reach of our hand is excellent and within our fruit&rdquo; &ndash; Us [we&rsquo;ll work on it later, but the idea&rsquo;s there, no? Well that&rsquo;s the point, isn&rsquo;t it?].<br>
  <br>
  But of course I should be expressive; better for my sanity, no? Better for the history to follow, for the propagation of kind, for the furtherance of the race/people/nation/intellectual-class/universe-of- chance... How foolish it all sounds when one lies, in a lawn, in a shade, eyes to the open sky. Into that open sky my Adorable World fades...my adorable world fades...you fade, they fade, professor fades, my own room fades...yet when the sky is full with my world as I had conceived it, when the open sky digests my eye, churns it over upon itself, turns it over upon it self, mixes and moves it, pushes it towards and pulls it from the sun... When the sky is full it will rain...and I&rsquo;ll be here, in my lawn &ndash; our lawn? &ndash; though we&rsquo;ll move out a little, from beneath our well-rooted tree; it&rsquo;s probably best I stand in the open &ndash; not so much that I might avoid the thunderstrike &ndash; but moreso that I can be wet again, that I might stand as my fresh clear thoughts &ndash; yes, these are indeed mine, I recognize them, their shape, their color, their feel, scent, their eternal reverberation and indeed their presence &ndash; as my fresh clear thoughts return from their cosmic adventure, return to their beginning, afresh, anew... [no no, too far, too far, they are let slip from the catacombs &ndash; yes! the catacombs, even in the sky, the twists, the turns, the terror, the darkness, the press on darkness that makes the gem, the shine of the gem that hides the darkness, the dawn of darkness in the light, from the light, within the light, the little lostness defines itself, corrects itself, finds itself, it wants itself!, and for itself, the pulchritudes, the beatitudes, the rectified, the ossified, the reified, the classified, the little boat that leaks the life &ndash; The horror! The horror!]<br>
  <br>
  that when the dawn &ndash; nay, when the dawning<br> 
  opens itself, opens myself<br> 
  I should like to be soaked,<br> 
  thunderstruck,<br>
  build my world again from my very own room<br> 
  with this wonderfully skeptical appreciation for windows from which I make &ndash; I begin &ndash; my embrace, <br>
  and a seat &ndash; a place? &ndash; a spot? &ndash; a presence [sure, with a bit of a smirk &ndash; let&rsquo;s say presence]<br> 
  and a presence unintendedly intended towards the open &ndash; the opening &ndash; sky,<br> 
  Something, probably, that I might make my own.<br>
  <br>
  *** I was struck by our readings by Virginia Woolf. It seems to me that she recognizes the primordial feeling, thought, or even exuberance that occurs in a thinker well before he can objectify, explain, even exude his thought. I especially remember a line to this point from <em>A Room of One&rsquo;s Own</em>, where Woolf realizes the difficulty in naming a great poet for her age because &ldquo;the living poets express a feeling that is actually being made and torn out of us at the moment&rdquo; (Woolf, <em>A Room of One&rsquo;s Own</em>, 1931). I found this to be characteristic of Woolf&rsquo;s work: she seemed to be putting on paper the feeling &ldquo;torn from her&rdquo; in the very moment she was writing. Accordingly, this was the approach I took in my creative rewrite.<br>
  <br>
  I did not particularly intend to &ldquo;rewrite&rdquo; either of the pieces of hers we read, but to see if I couldn&rsquo;t write in the same spirit. My first draft was fragmented, but of course it made sense to me because I was able to connect the fragments. There I recognized the second half of that &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; I was trying to imitate &ndash; the expression. Well that I should rile (or try to rile) that spirit in me, and even produce within me something of that spirit, but without the expression my imitation was incomplete; I had, to the best of my ability, to express, to objectify, the fruits of my thought.<br>
  <br>
  I said &ldquo;to the best of my ability&rdquo;, and by this I don&rsquo;t intend to argue simply that I&rsquo;m trying my hardest, and upon that ground justify my result. I mean to highlight the difficulty involved in expression, and in my imitation I attempted to do as much with those parts I put in brackets. Particularly interesting, now that I look back at it, is where I put &lsquo;something&rsquo; in brackets in the title, though left it without brackets in the piece&rsquo;s final line. This progression of &lsquo;something&rsquo; seems to me just as much an expression as any word or string of words one might put on paper: it is the approach of something definite, something concrete, out of something vague, something bracketed as a possibility, as an idea, as a string of letters trying to grip hold of a thought. In the end &lsquo;something&rsquo; remains, but now it&rsquo;s a word on paper, its objectified, it means something more than simply the thought I had and indeed more than my attempt at expressing that something when I bracketed it. The progression of &lsquo;something&rsquo; from beginning to end is the submerged truth of my something coming to the top, slowly in stages, from a thought in my mind to an unsure expression to a full-fold grasp of the idea as something objective, something not me (not subjective) though nonetheless for me &ndash; and indeed, something for you. This very paragraph could well be the final stage of bringing &lsquo;something&rsquo; to realization.<br>
  <br>
  This &ldquo;submerged truth&rdquo; should refer the reader back to Woolf&rsquo;s text: &ldquo;Yet it is in our idleness, our dreams, that the submerged truth sometimes comes to the top&rdquo; (<em>A Room of One&rsquo;s Own</em>, 1941). The whole of my imitation is an attempt to bring something to the surface, and watch it acquire a presence [yes, a presence] concretely <em>for</em> me and not simply <em>in</em> me. The acquisition slipped twice at least, in the catacombs and with an interruption, just as the &ldquo;truth&rdquo; slips Woolf&rsquo;s grasp on a few occasions:<br>
  <br>
  Truth had run through my fingers. Every drop had escaped. (<em>A Room of One&rsquo;s Own</em>, 1940)<br>
  <br>
  But here&rsquo;s a jerk. &ldquo;Eggs are cheaper!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what always happens! I was heading her over the waterfall, straight for madness, when, like a flock of dream sheep, she turns t&rsquo;other way and runs between my fingers&rdquo; (Woolf, <em>An Unwritten Novel</em>, 1960).<br>
  <br>
  Thought...had let its line down into the stream...until &ndash; you know the little tug &ndash; the sudden conglomeration of an idea at the end of one&rsquo;s line: and then the cautious hauling of it in, and the careful laying of it out? [...] The only charge I could bring against the Fellows and Scholars of whatever the college might happen to be was that in protection of their turf, which has been rolled for 300 years in succession, they had sent my little fish into hiding. 
  (<em>A Room of One&rsquo;s Own</em>, 1926)<br>
  <br>
  So the difficulty in grabbing the fish, the thought, my something.<br>
  <br>
  I think Woolf expressed that difficulty in the writing style of <em>An Unwritten Novel</em>: short staccato sentences, mixed with slightly longer descriptions, in a jumble of thoughts coming from several different directions at once.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Air above, air below. And the moon and immortality....Oh, but I drop to the turf! Are you down too, you in the corner, what&rsquo;s your name &ndash; woman &ndash; Minnie Marsh; some such name as that? There she is, tight to her blossom; opening her hand-bag, from which she takes a hollow shell &ndash; an egg &ndash; who was saying that eggs were cheaper? You or I? Oh, it was you who said it on the way home, you remember, when the old gentleman, suddenly opening his umbrella &ndash; or sneezing was it? Anyhow, Kruger went, and you came &ldquo;home a back way,&rdquo; and scraped your boots. Yes. And now you lay across your knees a pocket-handkerchief into which drop little angular fragments of eggshell &ndash; fragments of a map &ndash; a puzzle. I wish I could piece them together! If you would only sit still. She&rsquo;s moved her knees &ndash; the map&rsquo;s in bits again. Down the slopes of the Andes the white blocks of marble go bounding and hurtling, crushing to death a whole troop of Spanish muleteers, with their convoy &ndash; Drake&rsquo;s booty, gold and silver. But to return &ndash;<br>
  <br>
  To what, to where? (<em>An Unwritten Novel</em>, 1960) <br>
  I found this to really reflect the way a person thinks when they&rsquo;re on the brink of understanding something &ndash; here, where the narrator is about to piece the puzzle together.	Woolf highlights this brink by bringing an excitement to the narration at those points &ndash; the waterfall, the edge &ndash; where the thought seems to be collecting itself. She further employs dashes to add to the &ldquo;jumbled&rdquo; sense, which dashes I found to be very effective; to that end, I often incorporated them in my imitation. What I found in Woolf&rsquo;s style, and what I found difficult to imitate, was that in those passages that crescendo (waterfall, etc.) something about the text affected the way I read it. In my attempt to imitate, I learned that it was not simply the typography that creates such an effect, but that I would have to affect the tempo as well through word choice, sentence structure, and the like. I certainly found changes in typography to be helpful, however, and most strikingly so in the last, single-spaced section. There, I tried to convey a more structured, more &ldquo;together&rdquo; thought through a more tightly-knit format, yet I retained the dashes and bracketing to maintain a feeling of the inevitable difficulty of expression. The &lsquo;Something&rsquo; of that passage is significant: it is the first appearance of &lsquo;Something&rsquo; with a capitalized &lsquo;S&rsquo;, and is intended as a peak for the progression of &lsquo;something&rsquo; in the piece. Here, finally, &lsquo;something&rsquo; has some strength, some 
  standing, some fullness. However, I put &lsquo;Something&rsquo; at the beginning of the line, and while it might be considered capitalized for that reason, one notices that none of preceding lines in that passage begin with capitalized words &ndash; besides the &lsquo;I&rsquo; a few lines above &ndash; and the significance of the &lsquo;S&rsquo;, I hope, becomes clearer.<br>
  <br>
I also found Woolf using somewhat of an &ldquo;answer and question&rdquo; rhythm in <em>An Unwritten Novel</em>, which highlights the uncertainty of whatever conclusions the narrator &ndash; the thinker &ndash; might come to. I do not mean &ldquo;question and answer&rdquo;: questions followed by answers would have provided too much of a direction for the narrator&rsquo;s thoughts, but by not questioning anything until she had something in hand, Woolf opened the narrator&rsquo;s thought to anything that might slip in &ndash; indeed gave the thinking narrator an open sky.</p>

  I&rsquo;ve always liked to sing, not many appreciate it though, always shouting and interrupting me, sometimes even knocking me over.&nbsp; Some people don&rsquo;t appreciate true talent.&nbsp; Though just last week, I believe I was walking by someone&rsquo;s open window while I was singing and someone howled my name, I stopped to listen, but the house was strangely silent.&nbsp; Well, it&rsquo;s not my real name, but it&rsquo;s what people call me anymore, figured if that&rsquo;s what everybody calls me, it might as well be my name.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; Either way, it sounded like the girl was a bit confused, or maybe happy to see me, I like to keep my imagination active.&nbsp; I wonder what&rsquo;s become of her.&nbsp; I hope that she sees me soon.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  It&rsquo;s not often that I hear someone express an emotion other than fright or disgust.&nbsp; I can only assume one of two things, that my affliction has brought with it a kind of hideousness that would force even the holiest of men to turn a blind eye, or that people have developed a severe timidity not long after my going blind.&nbsp; Often times when I ask a sweet smelling woman for any help at all the answer is a shriek or shrill of some sort and, if I&rsquo;m lucky, a pelting of francs (better than Hivert&rsquo;s whip, certainly).&nbsp; The francs tend to be difficult to find, but at least I know they care.&nbsp; I believe that I should purchase some of their perfume once I have enough, after all it&rsquo;s only right, they even cared enough to pay for it.&nbsp; Maybe I would be keener to women. &nbsp;I heard that a stable boy that services the coach in Yonville took up good luck not too long ago, got himself a free surgery and all.&nbsp; Bet he&rsquo;s chasing the birds as we speak.&nbsp; What luck he has.<br>
  <br>
  I wonder where he got the courage to let another man cut him up.&nbsp; Maybe I should begin to take some of the advice that others shout at me.&nbsp; These men usually seem to believe that their advice is worth more than the francs they could have given me in much less time, but there may be something to them.&nbsp; What were the suggestions again?&nbsp; Smoke my clothes, pull wool over my eyes, fumigate my skin and don&rsquo;t produce dairy.&nbsp; Well, I don&rsquo;t seem to be producing any dairy. I suppose I could try hanging my clothes over a fire, modern day tastes seems to be getting stranger.&nbsp; I wonder what fumigate means&hellip; Pull wool over my eyes?&nbsp; I wonder... <br>
  <br>
  Trying to pull wool over my eyes, I don&rsquo;t think this advice was good at all.&nbsp; Since I&rsquo;ve gone blind I can see these people.&nbsp; In some ways I think that this blindness would be a blessing to a man of science, they are always looking to try to remove their own perspective on things, how about removing all perspective, it would be the purest of observations.&nbsp; I appreciate things in a different light now, I understand fully what the important things in life are.&nbsp; How I have such a desire for them now that I&rsquo;ve lost them.&nbsp; I hear about folks spending all their scruples on wealth and then their wealth on petty things like dining room sets, fancy shoes and piano lessons.&nbsp; How clear these things are to me now.&nbsp; Why should I bother them with this truth?&nbsp; Most of them seem happy enough.&nbsp; The birds, the sun, a little food, that&rsquo;s all I need.<br>
  <br>
  These are the values that I learned as a child.&nbsp; I was told that I only needed what helped me live, all those extra pursuits will just weigh my soul down. &nbsp;Father always told me that an idle mind is the devil&rsquo;s playground.&nbsp; I remember going to church so often, listening to the father speak, mostly about things that I knew nothing about.&nbsp; Now I mostly go because it&rsquo;s warm, I do very much enjoy hearing a voice that is not shrieked in terror though, I still don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s all about.&nbsp; I remember when I had a full day&rsquo;s work, and other people would actually take joy in seeing me, or at the very least be relieved.&nbsp; I was a butler in the house of Gaston, comte d&rsquo;Eu, it was such an honor to have worked for him.&nbsp; I was in charge of all of the servants, and we ran that house well.&nbsp; I was also entertainment from time to time, my specialty being the piano.&nbsp; I would love to play, but then again, nobody has been too keen on letting me touch theirs.&nbsp; I loved to play, but even more so, I loved to sing.&nbsp; I so enjoy the fold songs that my mother used to sing from her childhood.&nbsp; She always said that music calmed the heart, and folk songs educated the mind.&nbsp; I only ever performed these songs for Gaston&rsquo;s children, they enjoyed them.<br>
  <br>
  It was also my duty to keep the families piano in working order, I was granted the privilege to play it, I didn&rsquo;t want untrained hands touching it anyway.&nbsp; I remember the last time I tuned that piano, any piano in fact.&nbsp; I got distracted when one of Gaston&rsquo;s boys came into the room shouting one of my folk songs, I was so happy that he enjoyed it, then I turned around, still tightening the string, it snapped.&nbsp; Nothing&rsquo;s hurt quite like that.&nbsp; The position of butler is a coveted one, easily filled.&nbsp; The doctor did for me, but the problem was the festering.&nbsp; The doctor said that the string was most likely not very clean and that this was cause for concern.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t quite understand why that was a predicament but he went on to tell me about the somewhat recent studies that proved that washing was important when dealing with open wounds.&nbsp; In hindsight, he was right should have kept an eye on them, but the soap stung.<br>
  <br>
  No point in thinking about the rest I suppose, none of it really matters anymore.&nbsp; The only strings holding the working people up are their jobs, without that, we&rsquo;re all just beggars.<br>
  I do like to hear the stories outside of a pub or on a corner around the town center and listen to people gossip about each other.&nbsp; Just the other day I heard about a woman that acted with such tom-foolery; she spent all her husband&rsquo;s funds, accrued an enormous amount of debt, having thrown her last few francs to a beggar, she killed herself, Leaving her husband with child and debt.&nbsp; I know why someone would do this to themselves.&nbsp; I suppose her head was just stuck in the clouds, such silliness from those that are supposed to be learned; And what of her husband?&nbsp; Could he not keep his own accounts in order?&nbsp; To earn such money and just let it go, I wonder how much she gave that beggar, if they were going to throw it away I would have been happy to help catch it.&nbsp; But I suppose I can&rsquo;t really plan for this type of idiocy.<br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  The idiots don&rsquo;t seem to understand how the world works.&nbsp; They seem stuck in some fairy tale, and they avoid truth as if it were me. &nbsp;The truth seems disgusting to them, a disease that they fear will spread to their eyes, repulsive and sickening.&nbsp; So they avoid it as much as they can, and when they&rsquo;ve spent all their riches on delusion, and they are forced to take responsibility, they find the easiest path out of the mess they&rsquo;ve put themselves in.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll be finding out what eternity has in store for them, I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing to be done for someone that rejects the gift of life.<br>
  <br>
  I&rsquo;ll not lie, I&rsquo;ve thought about it many nights, mostly during the first few years of my becoming a beast of burden.&nbsp; But I understand the reality of the situation, after the piano string incident, the only way I can end it myself will cause an eternity of suffering.&nbsp; This certainly won&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; After living through what I have, there will be no argument that I deserve nothing short of a spot in heaven, after all, the last on Earth with be the first in heaven.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m certainly nowhere near first.&nbsp; I suppose it&rsquo;s not my place to judge&hellip;</p>
But I do hear the coach coming by.&nbsp; I better get focused, I hope Hivert is using his softer whip today.

<p class="style17"><span class="style16">Dada<br>
</span>Dada or Dadaism is a cultural movement that began in Z&uuml;rich, Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1922. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature&mdash;poetry, art manifestoes, art theory&mdash;theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti-war politics through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works. Its purpose was to ridicule what its participants considered to be the meaninglessness of the modern world. In addition to being anti-war, dada was also anti-bourgeois and anarchistic in nature. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada"><span class="style23"><span class="style24">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada</span></span></a></p>
<p class="style17"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#FF0000">Surrealism</font></b><br>
  Officially launched in 1924 by Andre Breton&#146;s <i>Manifesto on Surrealism</i>. 
  A rebellion against all restraints on free artistic creativity, including logical 
  reason, standard morality, social and artistic conventions and norms, and control 
  by forethought and intention. Uses automatic writing, dream material, states 
  of mind between sleep and waking and natural or artificially induced hallucinations. 
  Often united briefly with revolutionary political or social movements. <br>

  Surrealism was one of the most important movements of the twentieth century. Its central principles such as its belief in &quot;imagination without chains&quot; and its search for the &quot;spark of poetry&quot; in every day life, have had a lasting impact upon later artistic developments. Surrealism has also produced images whose ability to inspire and compel us has remained as powerful as ever.<br>
  <br>
  Desire&mdash;in its various manifestations&mdash;lay at the heart of some of the key concepts of Surrealism and permeated much of the art and poetry produced by the movement. Influenced by the Freudian notion that the sexual instincts were fundamental to the development of the psyche, the Surrealists also saw desire as a path to self-knowledge, &quot;a theatre of provocations and prohibitions in which life's most profound urges confront one another.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  For the Surrealists desire was implicated potentially in every thought and action, event and encounter. Desire embraced sublime exaltation and dark carnality. Above all, it was the wellspring of love. Described by the movement's leader, Andr&eacute; Breton, as the only thing capable of reconciling man with the idea of life, love was extolled and celebrated by the group with unprecedented intensity and seriousness. The first art movement to openly address love, sex and sexuality as part of its exploration of the human mind, Surrealism touched on issues that remain very much at the forefront of contemporary concerns&hellip;<br>

<p class="style17">Tralalalalalalalalalalalala!</p>
<p class="style17">Dada blasted onto the scene in 1916 with ear-splitting enthusiasm: rowdy, irreverant, and assaulting.</p>
<p class="style17">Its sounds were clamorous, its visions were shocking, and its language was explosive.</p>
<p class="style17">Yet Dada was not aimless anarchy.</p>
<p class="style17">Rather the artists were responding to the violence and trauma of World War I &mdash; and the  shock of modernity more generally &mdash; by developing shock tactics of their own. </p>
<p class="style17">They critiqued traditional concepts of the artist as master of his medium by using prefabricated materials or relegating aesthetic decisions to chance.</p>
<p class="style17">They scoffed at the conventional definition of the artistic media, expanding it to include the stuff of modern life &mdash; newspapers, magazines, ticket stubs, mechanical parts, food wrappers, pipes, advertisements, light bulbs, and so on. </p>
<p class="style17">Through their performances, publicity stunts, and manipulation of mass media, they further altered perceptions of what constituted a work of art by blurring the boundaries between art and life.</p>
<p class="style17">The outrageous provocations of the Dada movement have prompted many to define Dada as &quot;anti-art&quot;&mdash;a term that the dadaists themselves used. </p>
<p class="style17">Dada shock tactics, however, were meant less as wholesale disavowal of art, than turning away from conventional understandings of art as illusionistic or transcendental. </p>
<p class="style17">Art, the dadists believed, should not be an escape from daily events, but rather it should make visible the violence, chaos, and hyprocrisies of contemporary life. As the dadaist Hugo Ball wrote, &quot;For us, art is not an end in itself&hellip;but it is an opportunity for the true perception and criticism of the times we live in.&quot; Beneath the humor and absurdities of dadaism lies a serious moral underpinning.</p>
<p class="style17">The name Dada. According to the most likely story, the two Zurich dadists Hugo Ball and Richard Huelsenbeck happened upon &quot;dada&quot; in a French-German dictionary while searching for a stage name for a Cabaret Voltaire performer. The name appealed to the Caberet artists for its abstract and primitive sound and for its connection to the babble of babies. The word also had meanings in multiple languages: Dada is a child's word for &quot;hobbyhorse&quot; in French; &quot;yes, yes&quot; in Roumanian; and &quot;there, there&quot; in German. The group may have further liked how &quot;Dada&quot;&mdash;the brand name of a popular soap and hair tonic&mdash;echoed the slogans of consumer culture. With all these competing connotations, &quot;Dada&quot; typifies the group's desire to resist fixed meaning. As the artists themselves proclaimed, &quot;Dada means nothing.&quot; </p>

<p class="style17">Among Surrealist techniques exploiting the mystique of accident was a kind of collective collage of words or images called the <span class="style14">cadavre exquis (exquisite corpse)</span>. Based on an old parlor game, it was played by several people, each of whom would write a phrase on a sheet of paper, fold the paper to conceal part of it, and pass it on to the next player for his contribution.</p>
<p class="style17">The technique got its name from results obtained in initial playing, &quot;Le cadavre / exquis / boira / le vin / nouveau&quot; (The exquisite corpse will drink the young wine). Other examples are: &quot;The dormitory of friable little girls puts the odious box right&quot; and &quot;The Senegal oyster will eat the tricolor bread.&quot; These poetic fragments were felt to reveal what Nicolas Calas characterized as the &quot;unconscious reality in the personality of the group&quot; resulting from a process of what Ernst called &quot;mental contagion.&quot;</p>
<p class="style15">Free Union </p>
<p class="style17">Comments by a student: <em>Thoughts of &ldquo;Free Union&rdquo;</em> by Andr&eacute; Breton<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Andr&eacute; Breton&rsquo;s descriptive and intricate use of imagery within his work &ldquo;Free Union&rdquo; exemplifies the DADA movement of the early 20th century.&nbsp; Using metaphors to convey the beauty of a subject has been a long practiced style for poets, but until the DADA movement these metaphors retained a pattern of natural and almost heavenly tones.&nbsp; However Breton&rsquo;s work uses similes such as &ldquo;white mice,&rdquo; &ldquo;matches,&rdquo; &ldquo;rockets,&rdquo; &ldquo;asbestos,&rdquo; and others to describe her teeth, wrists, legs, and buttocks, creating a striking contrast between himself and earlier poets.&nbsp; These images are wild, mechanical, and quite odd when used for a comparison for beauty, but this was part of Breton&rsquo;s plot.&nbsp; He wants his reader to do a proverbial &lsquo;double-take&rsquo; when reading the poem; catching our attention, piquing our curiosity, and prompting our thoughts to wonder how one could find beauty in such ugly things.&nbsp; But he makes us see the beauty within these detestable things and brings it out to express not only the description of his wife, but his feelings toward her as well.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whose hair is a forest fire, her thoughts that are hot lightning&hellip;&rdquo; seem to show the reader his strong admiration for the &lsquo;fire&rsquo; or &lsquo;spark&rsquo; of her personality.&nbsp; Thought some of the images made appear a strange comparison, his message of eroticism, beauty, and passion he feels for his wife is evident.&nbsp; Creating such outlandish imagery and messages with his art was a defining trait of the DADA period; exaggerating their rebellion against what society accepts and screaming their uniqueness to the world.</p>

<p align="left" class="style17">Hear Andr&eacute; Breton reading the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LEyzHCOQT0">poem</a> in French.</p>
<p align="left" class="style17"><span class="style13">Free Union</span> is a surrealist example of a traditional poetic  form, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blason">blason</a>. <br>
  <br>
  &quot; Blason originally comes from French Heraldry and means either the codified description of a coat of arms or the coat of arms itself. The terms <em>blason</em>, <em>blasonner</em>, and<em> blasonneur</em> were used in 16th c. French literature by poets who, following Clement Marot in 1536, practised a genre of poems that praised a woman by singling out different parts of her body and finding appropriate metaphors to compare them with. It is still being used with that meaning in literature and especially in poetry. One famous example of such a poem, ironically rejecting each proposed stock metaphor, is William Shakespeare's Sonnet CXXX:<br>
  <br>
  My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;<br>
  Coral is far more red than her lips' red;<br>
  If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;<br>
  If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.<br>
  I have seen roses damasked, red and white,<br>
  But no such roses see I in her cheeks,<br>
  And in some perfumes is there more delight<br>
  Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.<br>
  I love to hear her speak, yet well I know,<br>
  That music hath a far more pleasing sound.<br>
  I grant I never saw a goddess go;<br>
  My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.<br>
  And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare<br>
As any she belied with false compare. &quot; </p>
<p align="left" class="style17">Here's another poem in the same parodic spirit:</p>
<p class="style17"><em>Nonsense Song</em><br>
  by W. H. Auden<br>
  <br>
  My love is like a red red rose<br>
  Or concerts for the blind,<br>
  She's like a mutton-chop before<br>
  And a rifle-range behind.</p>
<p class="style17">Her hair is like a looking-glass,<br>
  Her brow is like a bog,<br>
  Her eyes are like a flock of sheep<br>
  Seen through a London fog.</p>
<p class="style17">Her nose is like an Irish jig,<br>
  Her mouth is like a 'bus,<br>
  Her chin is like a bowl of soup<br>
  Shared between all of us.</p>
<p class="style17">Her form divine is like a map<br>
  Of the United States,<br>
  Her foot is like a motor-car<br>
  Without its number-plates.</p>
<p class="style17">No steeple-jack shall part us now<br>
  Nor fireman in a frock;<br>
  True love could sink a Channel boat<br>
  Or knit a baby's sock. <br>

<p class="style14">In addition, for this and the next assignment, take a look at  my web page on <a href="Explication.html"><em>Explication de Texte</em></a> and web sites listed on the <a href="222supmatf04.html">Supplementary Materials</a> page about figures of speech.<span class="style43"><font color="#990000"><font color="#000000"> These pages will also be useful for your <a href="222poetrypresentation.html">Poetry Presentation</a> due February 1 and 4. <br />

</a>This site is very cool because it has sound clips and draws from a wide range of speeches, movies, and more to illustrate the Figures of Speech. For example, see and listen to quotes from Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln, and Neil Armstrong on the page about antitheses: <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/figures/antithesis.htm">http://www.americanrhetoric.com/figures/antithesis.htm</a></span></p>
<p class="style1"><span class="style7">Class 3: (Pope, Lecture 2) </span><span class="style13">due Monday, January 14 </span> <br />
  1) Read <em>Essay on Man</em> and write a page  to turn in about your stanza to turn in. What is it about? Give a one sentence summary. Answer the 4 questions from Shannon. Also, what are the key words and images in the stanza? How does the stanza connect with the ideas of the Enlightenment we've discussed? What is the attitude of the narrator? What is the role of nature, especially animals, if any appear in your stanza?</p>
<p class="style1">2)<span class="style7"> <span class="style44">After reading Shannon Chapter 1, write your own definition of literature to turn in. Make it as short and complete as possible.</span></span></p>
<p class="style1"> 3) Your first WebCT post is due at midnight on Monday. <br />
  Instructions: Login to <a href="http://vista.ncsu.edu/index.php">WebCT Vista</a>. <br />
  Do the Browser check and enable pop-up windows.<br />
  Enter your Unity ID and Password. <br />
  On your My Courses page, click on FL 222. <br />
  Click on Student Orientation to WebCT. Read Sections 1 and 5. <br />
  To see the first discussion assignment, go back to the Home Page and click on Discussion Topics.<br />
  Click on Introduction.<br />
  You will see the first topic, Introductory Post, by me. Read the assignment (Please introduce yourself to the rest of the class and tell us: if you could invite any three people, alive, dead or fictional, to dinner at your place, whom would you invite, why, and what would you serve?). Respond. </p>
<p class="style1"> 4) See the <a href="Type/ExtraCreditType.html">Extra Credit Assignment on <em>Myers-Briggs Type in College</em></a> I'm INFJ. If you have comments or questions about Myers-Briggs Type, feel free to share them as part of the introduction. You can do this assignment any time in the first month of classes. </p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style7">Class 4 (Voltaire, Lecture 1) <span class="style13">due Wednesday, </span> <span class="style13">January 16 </span><br />
      <br />
      <span class="style44">1) Write a page about the first thirteen chapters of <em>Candide</em> answering Shannon's 4 questions. </span></span></p>
<p class="style14">2) Print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222ShortStoryNovel.html">Different Forms of Prose Fiction</a>; <a href="222SatireIronyUtopia.html">Satire, Irony and Utopia</a>. Read  <a href="222Panglossian.htm">Panglossian</a>.</p>
<p class="style14">3) Consider bookmarking an online dictionary or two to make it easy to look up words you don't know. If you are doing the Reading Notebook, you can print out the definitions to include in your notebook. <br />
    <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/">http://dictionary.reference.com/</a><br />
  <a href="http://www.m-w.com/">http://www.m-w.com/</a></p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style45">Class 5 (Voltaire, Lecture 2) <span class="style13">due Friday, January 18 </span><br />
      <span class="style4">Discuss the following question after you do the reading assignment (Chapters 14-22). Is Eldorado a genuine utopia or (in one critic's words) &quot;a colossal bore&hellip;satirized by Voltaire as foolish and futile&quot;? Which specific behaviors or institutions show us that Voltaire wants the reader to see Eldorado as utopic?  Does Voltaire have a philosophical lesson in mind or is it pure satire? Or both?</span></span> How does it correspond to your personal view of Utopia? <span class="style4">Quote from the text with examples to support your answers and include the page reference for each quotation.</span></p>
<p class="style14">See Lecture Notes on <a href="222dulce.html">Dulce et utile</a>.</p>
<p class="style14">The first original contribution post&mdash;on Pope&mdash;is due Friday at midnight. You will have many authors to choose from to do your required 13 posts (7 original contributions and 6 responses), but I encourage you to get in the habit of posting by starting with Pope or Voltaire. For an original contribution post, make a point or develop an argument of at least 7 lines based on something you read, learned or thought while reading <em>An Essay on Man</em>. It can be helpful to ask a question or make a provocative statement for your classmates to respond to. Did something in your homework get praise or a lot of comment from me? If so, it might be the basis of a good post. <br />
  <br /> 
Read Shannon, Chapter 2. </p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style7">Class 6 (Voltaire, Lecture 3)</span> <span class="style13">due Wednesday, January 23 </span><br />
  Read the page in Supplementary Materials, <a href="Candide%20quotes.html">Quotes from different critics about &quot;Il faut cultiver notre jardin.&quot; </a><br />
  Write a page answering the following questions: what are some  literal and figurative meanings of the word <em>garden</em>? How do they apply here? How do <strong>you</strong> interpret the final line of the story?</p>
<p class="style14">What do I mean by <strong>literal</strong> and <strong>figurative</strong>? Here is an example I found online at <a href="http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm">http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm</a> : <br />
    <br />
    <strong>literal</strong> vs. <strong>figurative</strong> meaning - relates to the meanings of words and phrases or expressions. For example, &quot;She was all ears&quot; has a <strong>figurative</strong> meaning (She was listening intently) as well as a <strong>literal</strong> meaning (Her body was composed of ears or she had a huge set of ears). </p>
<p class="style1">Read Shannon, Chapter 3 </p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style7">Class 7 (Romanticism; Pushkin, Lecture 1) </span><span class="style13">due Friday, January 25 <br />

Be sure to illustrate your answer with examples, complete with line numbers and direct quotes, from the poem as evidence.</font> It is optional to write about the <em>Note on Translation</em>, but I do want you to think about the difference between reading any literary work, but especially a poem, in its original language and in translation. You will have a chance to write about different translations of the same work when we study Baudelaire (2/29). <br />

<p class="style14">Here are two additional sets of critical questions you may choose to address. They were written by a former student, Garry Pigg (Fall, 2005)</p>
<p class="style33">ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM </p>
<p class="style14">1. How do the environmental/ecological conditions within the setting of the work affect the language, mood, tone, and theme?<br />
  2. How does the use of the word &quot;nature&quot; in the work reflect the current scientific beliefs of the time and how does that affect the characters, plot, themes?<br />
  3. How does the relationship between man/woman and his/her environment--economically, agriculturally, botanically, socially--affect the characters, language, theme, plot, and tone? i.e. do the characters have to hunt and gather, farm, trade, live in city, country?<br />
  4. How do plants, animals, and their conditions in the environment affect the character's livelihood, the plot, the author's tone, the moods, the theme? i.e. the effects of individual species such as cows, camels, horses,goats, bananas, sugar, cotton, corn, potatoes, fungi, bacteria,<br />
  viruses; and ambient conditions such as drought, flooding, pollution, climate change, introduction of invasive species, and famine.</p>
<p class="style33">QUEER THEORY </p>
<p class="style14">1. How do the cultural feelings about sex affect the characters, plot, and themes?<br />
  2. How does sexual identity affect the characters? How do they deal with others and their own sexual deviance or breaking of social norms?<br />
  3. How does homosexuality or bisexuality play a role in the characters' lives, the tone, mood, theme, and plot of the work?<br />
  4. What role does sexuality play in the work?  How does it affect the use of language? Does it represent love and beauty or marriage and<br />
  reproduction?<br />
  5. How does religion affect the tendencies of the characters to express or not express themselves sexually?<br />
  6. How does the work represent sex and sexuality?  Does it use sexuality to define &quot;others&quot;? Does discussion of sex in the work hinder or help feminism?  Does it hurt or help racism, discrimination in general, and civil rights?  What is the connection between sexuality, race, gender, and social class in the work(s)?</p>

  <br />
  <span class="style31"><span class="style32"><strong>&bull; FORMALIST CRITICISM</strong><br />
  <span class="style38">-Gustave Flaubert changes the narrative perspective/whose eyes the reader sees through many times through the novel. Is this helpful or harmful? <br />
  -How does Flaubert's use of indirect discourse and detached narration provide a way for him to express his opinions on each of the characters as well as on the manners and customs of provincial life?<br />
  -The color blue appears numerous times in almost every chapter. How does the use of this color in descriptions relate to the overall themes of love and despair?<br />
  -How do Emma's actions throughout <em>Madame Bovary</em> contribute to the overall meaning of the book?<br />
  -How do Rodolphe and Leon affect the overall plot of <em>Madame Bovary</em>?</span><br />
  <br />
  <strong>&bull; </strong></span></span><span class="style58">SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM<br />
&nbsp; Marxist Criticism</span><span class="style32"><br />
<span class="style59">-Throughtout</span></span></span></span></span><span class="style60"> the novel, Emma tries to move up in social status from the rurual middle class to the aristocracy. What steps does Emma take to elevate herself above her current position to reach the artistocracy? What does this say about Flaubert's ideas on social class position?<br /> 
-It seem like even in the old days people knew where they stood in society in terms of wealth. However, in <em>Madame Bovary </em>even though Charles is a doctor, he is looked upon numerous times as a peasant. Why did Flaubert do this?<br />
-In  <em>Madame Bovary </em>is Marxism used to separate the classes of people, as in the contrast between the wet nurse and the way Madame Bovary live. However, are these classes going to be continued through the story or will the struggle for a classless society succeed?<br />
-How does the author use the characters Emma and Charles to criticize the middle class?<br />
-Are any or all ofthe characters aware of their social class? If so, what evidence points to their knowledge? How do they react to their standings?<br />
-How does Flaubert distinguish between
social classes in <em>Madame Bovary</em>-what are the references to the bourgeois class? <br />
-Monsieur Lheureux and his agressive lending tactics to persons unable to afford the loans he so aggressively markets to them coincides with today's poor economic conditions relative to mortgage brokers' lucrative offers to potential homebuyers. Do you believe that the ramifications occuring to a person who is &quot;over their head&quot; financially is because of his/her own ignorance and desire to have more in this consumer-driven society OR should there be stricter moral and economic regulations put forth on the lenders because they are, in sense, &quot;taking advantage of the senseless&quot;? </span><span class="style20"><span class="style13"><span class="style4"><span class="style32"><br />
<br />
&nbsp; <strong>Feminist Criticism</strong><br />
  <span class="style54">-In the past, women have often been portrayed as dolls used for show and to take care of men. Do you think that the way Emma dresses and dreams of being in a higher social class coincides with this view? Do you think Emma is falling into the stereotype and not realizing it?<br />
  -How are women leading their lives? Do they do as they want or do they do as they are told?<br />
  -Does the relationship between Rodolphe and Emma reveal differing opinions between love/relationships of men and women? If so, is the author providing his views or criticism of how women and men differ in viewing love? </span></span></span></span></span><span class="style61"><br />
  -Does it both Emma that Charles is the only source of income in the house? Does she wish she had something to do with her time?<br />
  -Emma has a husband who loves her and a new baby but it seems that she's not happy with what she's got and wants more. Provide examples from the text that prove that Emma wants more in her life than living in Yonville with her husband and baby.<br /> 
  -How are women portrayed in the story? What's their gender role? How do they react to it? <br />
  -Emma seems very smart and treated with respect. What is her unhappiness? Why is she unhappy after being treated nicely by Leon? She is  a woman and maybe should have less say and rights during this time period.</span><span class="style20"><span class="style13"><span class="style4"><span class="style32"><br /> 
  <br />
  &bull; 
  <strong>CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM</strong><br />
  <span class="style62">-How would <em>Madame Bovary</em> be different if Flaubert wrote in the Romantic Period? <br />
  -How can the cultural and historical settings of <em>Madame Bovary</em>, which takes place in 1840s France, be related to modern readers? <br />
  How does the rise of the bourgeoisie and their values fit into the story and the way of life of the characters in it?  <br /> 
  -How does the role of history affect the realism in this novel, and how is it different from the Romantic period?<br /> 
  -How did Gustave Flaubert use realism and themes from the 19th century in his story <em>Madame Bovary</em>?<br />
  - Do you think the sense of family values and the sacredness of marriage has changed from the time of this story to now?<br /> 
  -How do the mannerisms and language style of the characters compare to the time period for which <em>Madame Bovary</em> was written in as well as how do they compare to the modern mannerisms and language style of the United States?<br />
  -What cultural roles were addressed in <em>Madame Bovary</em> and in what context were they presented? Was culture an influence and in what ways is it reflected in the story?   </span><br />
  <br />
  <strong>&bull; 
  PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM</strong><br />
  <span class="style63">-How and what may be the cause of each character's delusions? What could be the root cause of it? <br />
  -Flaubert provides a sense of insecurity in <em>Madame Bovary</em> through Emma's character. Is this insecurity reflected in Emma reflective of Flaubert's feelings or experiences in life? What is Flaubert thinking when he continues to make Emma's life a miserable happiness? <br />
  -How does <em>Madame Bovary</em> reflect Flaubert's personal psychology?  <strong><br />
  </strong>-What does Emma's behavior/emotions reveal about kind of person she is/ personality she has? What does Charles' behavior/emotion or lack thereof, reveal about his personality?</span><br />
  <strong><br />
&bull;
  READER RESPONSE CRITICISM</strong></span><span class="style7"><br />
  -What are your feelings towards Emma? Do you sympathize with her or are you annoyed by her actions? Does your personality type influence the way you feel about Emma or do you know someone like Emma? <br />
  -Who do you think is repsonsible for the many misfortunes that occur in the story: Emma or Charles? Why do you think they are to be blamed? <br />
  -Emma has many relationships throughout the novel. Compare and contrast the relationships that Emma has with Charles, Leon and Rodophe. When does she meet them, how does she act towards them? Also, what are the differences in all the men that she is with in this novel? In the end, who do you think she loves the most?<br />
  -Obviously, <em>Madame Bovary</em> was written before the time of medical diagnosis for mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, etc. Do you think that more people today can relate to Emma and her unhappy state? Does her behavior make more sense and appear more common to audiences of today rather than in the past? If so, is it easier for intended audiences of today to relate to Emma and understand her complex personality? <br />
  -In general, do you think a lot of people's lives nowadays are goverened by the idea the grass is always greener on the other side? In terms of story, are the some people who dream up a better life with another person and then commit adultery because they are unhappy with the life they lead? If there are people like this in our world, which I know there are, does this in turn affect the way these people interpret the story versus the way other people who don't believe that see this story?<strong><br /> 
  <br />
  </strong></span><span class="style58">&bull; ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM </span><span class="style32"><br />
  <span class="style64">-How is Madame Bovary affected by the environment of the city compared to the environment of the country? How does her mood, her look, and her well-being change in each environment? And does the environment and her lovers' characters correlate with the environment that she has relations with them?</span> <span class="style64"><br />
  -Why does the nature and the environment around Yonville seem to affect Leon and Emma so negatively?<br />
  -How does the contrast between the environments Emma experiences affect her overall attitude, as well as the general tone of the novel? Consider soical, economic, and agricultural environments and also how Emma's attitude affects other characters throughout the story.
  </span><br />
  <strong><br />
  &bull; QUEER THEORY</strong><br />
  </span></span></span></span><span class="style20"><span class="style13"><span class="style4">-How does Madame Bovary's overwhelming sexuality and breaking of the social norm of marriage affect the other characters of the story? <br />  
  -How does Flaubert use the characters in <em>Madame Bovary</em> to portray his idea of the restrictions of gender roles? Emma seems ready to prostitute herself to pay off her debts. Was he trying to suggest that females must use their bodies to get anywhere in life? <br />
  -&quot;There is no lonelier woman than one who degrades her gender by using it to get special favors.&quot; How does this quote relate to Emma Bovary's character? What type of stereotypes exist about women and how does Emma's character epitomize the stereotypes? <br />
  </span></span></span>-Given the fact that Emma is very romantic and expresses Romantic thoughts, how do her sexual thoughts and emotions affect other characters and herself? Why is she always having these sexual thoughts? <br />

Father keeps custody of the Son, who is raised by a wet nurse and grows up to be very resentful. The wife obediently leaves the family home and she and the former secretary have 3 more children. The Father watches over them, but eventually they move away; the stepfather dies, and the wife and three children move back to the original town without telling the Father. Mother and Stepdaughter take jobs with a dressmaker, Madame Pace, who runs a call-girl service: Mother as a seamstress, Stepdaughter as a prostitute, who is ultimately hired by the Father. Family is reunited: explosive conflict.</p>

    2) Also: </span><span class="style14">&quot;The Oedipus complex in Freudian psychoanalysis refers to stage of psychosexual development in childhood where children of both sexes regard their father as an adversary and competitor for the exclusive love of their mother. The name of the complex derives from the Greek myth of Oedipus, who unwittingly kills his father Laius and marries his mother Jocasta.<br />
  <br />
      Freud considered the successful resolution of the Oedipus complex to be key to the development of gender roles and identity, with boys and girls resolving the conflicts differently as a result of castration anxiety and penis envy. Freud also held that the unsuccessful resolution of the Oedipus complex could result in neurosis and homosexuality.&hellip; Although common usage refers to 'suffering from an Oedipus complex', psychoanalysis does not consider the complex a pathology, but instead a perfectly normal stage that all children go through. Oedipal desires are thought to remain heavily repressed and unconsciously in the minds of all functioning adults.</span>&quot; <br />

&bull; 'Gregory, open the door please.' Nothing was further from Gregory's mind, however; in fact he was congratulating himself on his cautious habit, adopted from his travels, or locking all the doors of his room at night even when he was at home. (p. 1968) </em>What does this say about the personal world Gregory lives in? What does this excerpt say about Greogory's family, influcences and surrounding? Given what has happened to Greogory thus far, how does the literal title of <em>The Metamorphosis</em> fit into the non-physical aspect of the story? <br />
&bull; How does Kafka's attention to detail, yet lack of description of the insect, contribute to the overall meaning of the story?<br />
&bull; Gregory's sister is not refered to by her first name until the end of Chapter 2. Why is she refered to as &quot;Gregory's sister&quot; and then as &quot;Meg,&quot; and when the father came home after the mom had passed out, they  were referred to as &quot;women&quot;?
<br />
&bull; What issues are raised by this work relate to how the family treats Gregory after he turns into a bug? Are these issues ever resolved?<br />
&bull; Why hasn't Gregory really asked himself why he has changed into an insect? 
</p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style83">Sociological &mdash; Marxist:</span><br />
&bull; Is Gregor's life as an insect just an extension of his life as a human? <br />
&bull; How do economic conditions determine Gregory's life?<br />
&bull; Is the cause of the metamorphosis the economic pressure put on Gregory and if so, what are the pressures that cause it? </p>
<p class="style14"> <span class="style58">Feminist:</span><br />
&bull; How are the women, or female gender roles, portrayed in the story?</p>
<p class="style14"> <span class="style58">Cultural and Historical:</span><br />
&bull; What is the cultural significance of Gregor turning into a giant insect?<br />
  &bull; Looking at historical perspectives, families tend to rely on their own members for a change or spiritual awakening, wheter it is a family member's death, tranformation, or physical change. Why does this still occur today?<br />
  &bull; Since Kafka was born in cultural alienation and always complained about his inability to love, how would  
  <em>The Metamorphosis</em> be different if he was strongly cultured and now no problem with love? <br />
  <br />  
  <span class="style78">Psychological:<br />
  </span><span class="style16">&bull; Was Gregor's metamophosis really a delusional affect from work and stress or maybe even a dream? </span><br />
&bull; Is Gregory really a bug or is he dreaming and would his family really treat him this way? <br />
&bull; What do each of the characters'&mdash;Meg, Gregory, and their mother and father&mdash;emotions, behaviors and actions reveal about their psychological status in the first half of <em>The Metamorphosis</em>, especially as Gregory's trnasformation progresses? What do these emotions and behavior reveal about the type of personalities each has?<br />
&bull; Does the transformation that Gregory goes through have anything specific to do with his existence?<br />
&bull; What does Gregory think of himself?<br />
&bull; Does Gregor's father lash out at him to relieve the pain of losing his job or due to the frustration of losing a son?<br />
&bull; Does the character's metamorphosis reflect a deep-rooted psychological issue that is a result of a lack of acceptance as an individual?<br />
&bull; Based in how Gregor's famiy reacted to the discovery of Gregory's new physical features, why do you think they did not think it was odd that Gregor turned into a bug?<br />
&bull; Why do you think Kafka chose an insect instead of another organism? Also why does Greogory not question his metamorphosis?<br />
&bull; How does <em>The Metamorphosis</em> reflect Kafka's life and his relationship with his family? <br />
&bull; What do the characters' emotions and behaviors towards Gregory (now transformed into a bug) say about their emotional state?<br />
&bull; How could anyone who is transformed overnight into a bug stay psychologically sane? (I am not saying that he should act like an insect, but if I were transformed, I would probably go insane and end up slitting my many wrists.)<br />
&bull; Based on the first half of the story, what do you think led to the metamophosis of Gregor?<br />
&bull; Was Gregor's metamorphosis really a delusional affect from work and stress of maybe even a dream?<br />
&bull; Do you think Gregor's transformation is just a change on the outside? Do you think that he changes on the inside? </p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style78">Reader-Response:</span><br />
  &bull; Have you ever felt like a bug, as in very different from anyone else?<br />
    &bull; Why did Kafka describe the protagonist as some sort of vile insect?<br />
    &bull; What are your feelings about Gregory? How would you react if you were Gregory and how would you act if you were Gregory's family?<br />
    &bull; How does the reader feel about the ambiguity of the bug form itself?  
  <br />
    <span class="style58"><br />
Queer:</span><br />
Why did Kafka choose to establish Gregory's lack of romantic relationships first and why is that significant in his isolation? </p>

<p>Here's an exercise that helps you put a work of art in context in the museum setting.</p>
<p>Before visiting the museum, pick a work that interests you. Take some notes about it. Do the looking X 10 exercise, where you look at the work for 30 seconds, jot down ten things that come to mind, and repeat. Find out some background about the artist and the period.</p>
<p>When you go to the museum, visit your painting. How is it different seeing it in person? What is the context of the work in the gallery? How is the work hung and lit? What about the other works in the same gallery? How are they similar and different? Why do you think the curators made these choices about which works to select and where to put them? Do you see your work differently because of these other works in the gallery?</p>

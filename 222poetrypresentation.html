<p>This project will be done with one or two partners.</p>
<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>1. You may choose any poem in our anthology from the Romantic Period, pages 900-1039 in the text book. Authors include <span class="purple">Barbauld, Blake, H&ouml;derlin, Wordsworth,  Coleridge, Bunina, Bello, Shelley, Keats,  Heine, Leopardi, Browning, Tennyson,  Whitman,</span> and <span class="purple">Dickinson</span>. Do <strong>not</strong> choose the two poems I will present in class, Wordsworth's &quot;Ode on Intimations of Immortality&quot; or Keats' &quot;Bright Star&quot;. </p>
<p>For fun and as a warm up, read  <a href="222Collins.html">"Introduction to Poetry"</a> by Billy Collins, and once you know something about Emily Dickinson, read his poem about her as well.</p>
<ul><li>Make a copy of the poem you will present.</li>
<li>Read chapters 4, 12 and 14 of <span class="text">A Short Guide to Writing about Literature</span>. Students have told me that they wished they had read chapter 17 &quot;Writing a Research Paper&quot; before doing the poetry paper, so if has been a while since you wrote a humanities paper, you might want to check it out.</li><li>Read the poem out loud, using <a href="222reading poetry.html">this web page</a> for guidance.</li>
<li>For  helpful suggestions and vocabulary to use in your analysis and 
  presentation, see <a href="Explication.html"><i>Explication de texte</i></a>, a handout based on the French method of doing a close reading of a text.</li>
<li>Find an appropriate article for the <a href="222CriticalSkills.html">Critical Skills</a> Exercise (Start early; it may take a while to find a good article.)</li>
<li>Annotate your poem. Look up any words, historical, or geographical references in the poem that aren't familiar to you. Jot down these clues. Show which words or images belong together by using color or circles to link the words. <a href="222Popeannotation.pdf">Here</a> is an example  on a few lines from Pope's &quot;Essay on Man,&quot; and I will pass around other examples in class. Be sure to include the insights you gain from your annotation in your paper!</li>
<li>The University offers <a href="http://tutorial.dasa.ncsu.edu/writing-speaking/">writing and speaking tutorial services</a>.</li>
</ul>
  <p>If your poem was not originally written in English, before you draw any conclusions about rhyme scheme or specific vocabulary, it is a good idea to  at least <em>look</em> at the poem in the original language. I've started building a <a href="222romanticpoemsoriginallanguages.html">web page</a> of the most popular poems in their original languages.</p>
<p>You will do some biographical research about your poet. See the <a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/course/FL/222">Library Tools</a> page to see resources available to you from NCSU Libraries. You will also consult at least one secondary source for the critical skills exercise portion of this assignment. A good place to start is the Selected Bibliographies section at the back of the textbook, pages A3-A10). If you consult other materials (articles, books, internet, YouTube), be sure to quote and document them properly and attach a &ldquo;Works Cited&rdquo; page. </p>
<p>Plagiarism is a poor choice and will not be tolerated. For information on the paper's format and for research and writing the documentation page, consult <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>, Chapters 14 and 15.</p>
<p>2. Type a short paper of 3-4 pages (not including the annotation, critical skills exercise and  works cited pages) to turn in to me. (No online submissions accepted.) Although you may present with a partner or partners, each student should turn in an individual paper. If you wish to turn in a joint paper, all partners will get the same grade, and I will photocopy the submitted paper to return to each member. Note: even if you are presenting with a partner, each student must choose a different article for the <a href="222CriticalSkills.html">Critical Skills</a> Exercise. Include:</p><ul>
  <li>Your annotated copy of the poem. (See these  sample annotations: <a href="Laura070.pdf">1</a>, <a href="Derek071.pdf">2</a>, <a href="Poetry001.pdf">3</a>.)</li><li>Essential or relevant background about the author.</li>
  <li> 
Your observations about the literary aspects of the poem, figures of speech, imagery, rhyme and rhythm, and form, based on your annotation, <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> and the <em><a href="Explication.html">Explication de texte</a></em> handout. For another helpful guide doing a close reading of a poem, see <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/~englblog/closereading/">this</a> page.</li><li>At least one paragraph about the poem's meaning.</li>
<li> Observe, describe, summarize. Be sure that you have a clear beginning, middle and end in your paper. Revise for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words. For suggestions on words to eliminate see <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/~gkblank/wordiness.html">Wordiness</a>.</li>
<li>Your Critical Skills Exercise</li>
<li>A &quot;Works Cited&quot; page for any secondary sources used.</li></ul>
<p>3. Prepare to present the poem and the highlights of your observations to the 
class. You may use notes, but do not read from your paper. Plan to read at least one verse from your poem out loud.  Work with your partner(s) to make an effective and engaging presentation to the class. Practice with your partner so that you use your 5 minutes effectively. I will be looking for the qualities identified in the <a href="222AssessmentGuideOral.html">Assessment Guide for Oral Presentations</a>, and using this rubric to grade your oral presentation.</p>
<h2>Evaluation </h2><p>For the written work, I will be looking at: your thoughtful annotations; your ability to detect and describe the poetic elements of the poem: figures of speech, the human senses evoked, how form and content reinforce each other;  your thoughts about why the writer may have used this imagery; 
how well you are able to summarize, in just a few sentences, some of the main 
ideas or the meaning of the poem. In short, I will be looking at the qualities identified in the <a href="222writingassessment.html">Writing Assessment for Short Assignments.</a></p>

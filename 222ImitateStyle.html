  <p><font color="#003333" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SOME 
  QUALITIES TO LOOK FOR WHEN YOU IMITATE A PARTICULAR AUTHOR OR TEXT</font></p>
</div>
<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br />
    <font color="#FF0000">The ideas</font>. Are they: abstract or concrete; objective 
    or subjective; banal or original; traditional or revolutionary; logical or illogical; 
    plausible or implausible; individual or universal; clear or obscure; obvious 
    or subtle; spiritual, fantastic, bold, naive, philosophical, symbolic, moralistic, 
    etc?<br />
    <font color="#FF0000"><br />
      The sentiments, emotions.</font> Does the text (or the characters) express: 
    enthusiasm, calm, exaltation, sorrow, harmony, delicateness, emotion, sensitivity?<br />
    <font color="#FF0000"><br />
      The composition.</font> Is the arrangement classical (clear, ordered, logical, 
    methodical, rigid) or non-classical (anthithetical, illogical, unevenly balanced). 
    Is there progression or opposition in the different parts of the text; 
    is there contrast, repetition, order or disorder?<br />
    <br />
    <font color="#FF0000">The style.</font> Is it consistent, varied, rich, full 
    of images; static, dynamic concise, rapid, life-like? Are the words technical, 
    picturesque, simple, erudite, subtle, varied? Are the words and the passage 
    as a whole obscure, confusing, unobtrusive, concrete, abstract, realistic?<br />
    <br />
    <font color="#FF0000">Sources</font>. Did the author use his imagination, reality, 
    fairy tales, mythology, the fantastic, history, folklore?<br />
    <font color="#FF0000"><br />
      The sentences</font>. Are they short or long; periodical (lots of dependent 
    clauses), circular, rapid, slow? When read aloud is the passage musical or dissonant; 
    fluid or heavy; discreet, vehement; simple or oratorical? Is the rhythm smooth 
    or choppy, varied, monotonous or majestic?<br />
    <br />
    <font color="#FF0000">The effect on the reader</font>. How is the reader's interest 
    held? Is the passage consistent in tone, dramatic, suspenseful, anticlimactic? 
    Does the text convince, frighten, amuse, describe, evoke? <br />
    <br />
    <font color="#FF0000">How does it do this?</font> Lightnesss, reason, seriousness, eloquence, sensorial evocations, humor, irony, 
    absurdity, poetry, exageration, parody, understatement?<br />
    <br />
    <font color="#FF0000">Evaluation</font>. Is there a moral intention? Is the 
    text essentially poetic, didactic, comic, tragic, or sentimental? Is there an 
    underlying philosophy or point of view? Or is it art for art's sake, that is, 
    existing only as art?<br />

<p class="style3">Does the camera move or remain stationary?  How do camera movements or lack of them affect your responses?</p>
<p class="style3">How does the visual information (ie. details of the frame) of an image determine meaning?</p>
<p class="style3">How long are the shots in a particular film, and how do long takes or rapid montages affect our  responses?</p>

<p class="style3">How does the music affect your emotional response in  particular sequences?</p>
<p class="style3">Consider the effectiveness of the actors in films. For instance, some actors are brilliant in theater but not always so in film. Why?</p>
<p class="style3">Consider the relationships of sound to the images. </p>
<p class="style3">Do the costumes just look &ldquo;nice,&rdquo; or do they help support characterization and/or theme?</p>

<p class="style1"> &ldquo;Known by many names&mdash;&lsquo;The City of Lights,&rsquo; &lsquo;The City of Love,&rsquo; &lsquo;Gay Paree&rdquo;&mdash;Paris is . . . one of Europe&rsquo;s oldest and most celebrated cities.  Behind the famous monuments such as the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre museum, and the Champs-Elys&eacute;es, Paris is a bustling cosmopolitan metropolis, with business of all kinds and colorful local culture, enriched by decades of immigration from France&rsquo;s former colonies.  The city prides itself on the beauty of its architecture and has strict laws about building inside the city limits in order to preserve its charm.  It is also associated with the world&rsquo;s best gastronomy, fashion, and hospitality.  Paris has its origins in Roman times, as evidenced by ancient ruins within the city.&rdquo;  To understand European and American history, understanding Paris is essential.  This class will introduce students to the French language (a major influence on English), and look at the role Paris played and still plays on the world stage. <br />
  <br />
  There are no pre-requisites for the course.&nbsp;The language of instruction is English. If you are interested in beoming proficient in French , you might sign up for FLF 101 or FLF 110 as well. There will be intensive French tourist language instruction as part of on-campus, pre-departure classes. Students proficient in French will be able to submit the final paper in French. </p>

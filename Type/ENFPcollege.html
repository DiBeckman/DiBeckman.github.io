  &bull;

  &bull;
  May not finish projects if they don't care enough about the topic <br />
  &bull;
  May say &quot;yes&quot; to anything interesting with little sense of priority <br />
  <span class="style4"><br />
  Dealing with Stress </span><br />
  &bull; Naturally good at getting things done at the last minute with a burst of energy  <br />

<h2>PLACEMENT AND PREREQUISITES</h2> <p>A score of 14-19/ 246-288 on the NCSU Placement 
  Test is required. You will be asked to fill out the departmental Prerequisite form with your score on the first day of class. The Placement Test can be taken in the Foreign Language Technology 
  Center (214 Laundry Bldg). The test will take 20-25 minutes and you will receive 
  the results immediately. See <a href="http://fll.chass.ncsu.edu/academics/placement.php">this page</a> for more information.</p>
<p>This course is designed for the student who has had 
  at least 1-2 years in high school and would like a thorough review of the 101 material 
  before doing the 102 material. It is not designed for the student who has not had French 
  (or another foreign language) previously.<strong>  The time commitment outside of class is significant</strong>. </p>
<p>Develop a <span class="fuchsia">Growth Mindset</span>: The next time you take a class on a subject you fear because you think you are not &quot;smart&quot; in that area, keep in mind that practice can make a huge difference in your learning success.  The class may not be easy for you, but if you have some background knowledge in the subject or take the time to learn some background information (e.g., through learning development courses or tutoring) and you work hard (keep a growth mindset), there is no telling what you will achieve. Read more on the subject <a href="Mindsets towards Learning.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENT: Foreign Language Proficiency for Graduation</strong>.
  If eligible, upon admission to NC State, all students are notified during New Student Orientation and will receive a notation on their Automated Degree Audit (ADA) stating that they have met the university foreign language proficiency requirement &ndash; the equivalent of FL 102 / FL Elementary II &ndash; as &ldquo;FL* 100 High School *** PF.&rdquo; Completing FLF 110 also meets the FL 102 requirement. In order to satisfy the GEP Foreign Language Requirement, proficiency at the FL 102 level must be met with a letter-grade. Opting to take FL 102 for credt-only (S/U) will not satisfy the requirement.</p>
<h2>LEARNING OUTCOMES</h2><p>At the end of this course, students will be able to:</p><ol>
<li>use learned grammatical structures to speak and write in elementary or novice-level 
  French; </li>
<li>create written and oral sentences using learned vocabulary;</li>
<li>read French at the elementary or novice level;</li>
<li>understand spoken French at the elementary or novice level;</li>
<li>identify aspects of the cultures of the French-speaking world.</li></ol>
<h2>WELCOME TO FRENCH!</h2> <p>This course aims at giving you a solid foundation 
  in understanding, speaking, reading and writing the French language at the elementary 
  level. To accomplish these goals, it is essential that we use French as the 
  language of the classroom. Handy phrases for communicating in French: </p>
<p><span class="red"><em>R&eacute;p&eacute;tez, s'il vous pla&icirc;t</em></span> = Repeat, please.<br />
<span class="red"><em>Une minute, s'il vous pla&icirc;t</em></span>. = Wait 
  a minute, please.<br />
<span class="red"><em>Comment dit-on [English word] en fran&ccedil;ais</em></span>  = How do you say [English word] in French?<br />
<span class="red"><em>Que veut dire [French word]?</em></span>= What does 
  [French word] mean?<br />
<span class="red"><em>Qu'est-ce que c'est?</em></span> = What's that?<br />
<span class="red"><em>Je ne sais pas.</em></span> = I don't know.<br />
<span class="red"><em>Je ne comprends pas.</em></span> = I don't understand.</p>

<p>Although the language of instruction and interaction in my classroom is French, I do not expect you to  understand every single word I am saying. Do not hesitate to let me know if your confusion gets in the way of class participation. I will find another way of getting my point across, whether it is by repeating, paraphrasing, elaborating, or simply slowing down. Raising your hand in class is the best way to let me know you have a question. Please come see me after class or during my office hours! Every student will benefit from one-to-one time with me whether you have questions about grammar, pronunciation, or simply to practice speaking French. </p>
<h2>HOW TO DO WELL IN CLASS</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Prepare assignments before coming to class</strong> so we can get the most 
  out of our class time together. Assignments are to be completed as indicated 
  on the syllabus. I expect you to have studied the grammar points as explained in the textbook and completed the homework <strong>before</strong> coming to class with any questions. In class, I will be presenting the same material in French as a <strong>review</strong> before we do face-to-face exercises (teacher-student and student-student) in class. Some students find it helpful to read written explanations in both <span class="text">Motifs </span>and <span class="egsf text">English Grammar for Students of French</span> before coming to class, for difficult grammar points. Others consult general French grammar web sites such as <a href="http://www.laits.utexas.edu/tex/">Tex's French Grammar</a> and others  listed on the <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~dsbeckma/110supp.htm">Supplementary Materials</a> page. Part of my job is to help you  find the approach that keeps you in the stretch zone and works well for you, depending on your learning style (see <a href="Type/ExtraCreditType.html">Extra Credit Assignment on <em>Myers-Briggs Type in College</em></a>). We are most likely to figure this out together during a tutoring session in my office, so don't hesitate to come see me.</li>
<li><strong>Homework is essential.</strong> You will have daily homework. It is necessary to do the homework to succeed on the exams. There is a  <strong>significant</strong> amount of work for this class. It is important to keep up and   impossible to cram for this course 
  and do well. You will not be able to absorb all the grammar points from classroom instruction alone.  That is why there is homework,  a lab manual,  resources on the <a href="http://login.cengagebrain.com">Cengage</a> site, and my <a href="110supp.htm">Supplementary Materials</a> page. Learning a language is like building a house of cards; each one 
  must be well in place before adding the next. Getting behind can lead to serious difficulties <strong>including an F in the class</strong>. Spend at least 30 
  minutes on French per day. Regular 
  repetition of small quantities of information is the most successful method 
  for learning a foreign language.</li>
<li><strong>Participate actively</strong> in class. Mentally answer each and every 
  question when a classmate is responding. Class participation and homework make 
  up 25% of your grade. The more you participate, the better your grade will be, 
  and the better your French will become. Your class grade reflects your performance 
  in class (attendance, knowledge of daily lesson, volunteering answers, asking 
  questions). Take listening comprehension seriously &#151; it will help both your proficiency and your grade. There will be a listening component 
  on all exams. </li>
<li><strong>Take risks</strong>. Speak out. Don&#146;t be afraid to make mistakes. I am 
  here to help. The more you speak, the more you will get out of the class. Save perfection for exams. The desire to communicate is the most important 
  consideration when speaking. </li>
<li><strong>Speak French as much as possible</strong> in the classroom. Speak French outside 
  the classroom whenever possible, too. Listen to French music, go to French movies, 
eat French food!</li>
<li>Do not chew gum in class. Having something in your mouth makes it harder to pronounce French correctly.</li>
<li><strong> Bring <span class="text">Motifs</span> to class every day</strong>. This is essential.  Bring a portable French/English-English/French dictionary to class, if you find it useful. Alternatively, you can consult an online resource such as <a href="http://wordreference.com">http://wordreference.com</a> or ask me for vocabulary assistance in class. </li>
<li><strong>Take notes</strong> in class. I can put any poster that I put on the board up on my <a href="110supp.htm">Supplemenatary Materials</a> page, if it isn't already there. Buy 3x5 notecards to make 
  personalized verb charts and other study aids. I like to use colored index cards with pink for feminine nouns and blue for masculine. Study with a friend
  outside of class. There are excellent study tips in <span class="egsf text">English Grammar for Students of French</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Cell phones and mobile devices must be silent and out of sight</strong> during class. If you need to know what time it is, you may ask me (in French, of course: <em>Quelle heure est-il</em>?). No texting during class. If I see you use your phone during class, it will count against your participation grade. </li></ol>
<p>I will do my best to keep the class atmosphere creative, lively, and accepting 
  of your best efforts. Both <strong>effort</strong> and <strong>ability</strong> will be rewarded. In return, you, too have some responsibilities. Please 
read carefully and follow the advice above and the information  given below.</p>
<h2>GRADING</h2><ul> 
<li>Participation and attendance, Homework (Green pages, Workbook, <em>English Grammar for Students of French</em>), Museum Visit Paper, Class Work: <span class="red">25 %</span></li>
<li>Quizzes, Compositions/Projects, <em>Pays Francophone </em>Presentation: <span class="red">25 %</span></li>
<li>Exams: <span class="red">25 %</span></li>
<li>Final Exam: <span class="red">25 %</span></li></ul>
<p>There will be plus/minus grading in this class. The scale will be as follows:<br />
  A+ = 97.0-100, A = 93.0-96.9, A- = 90.0-92.9, <br />
  B+ = 87.0-89.9, B = 83.0-86.9, B- = 80.0-82.9, <br />
  C+ = 77.0-79.9, C = 73.0-76.9, C- = 70.0-72.9, <br />
  D+ = 67.0-69.9, D = 63.0-66.9, D- = 60.0-62.9,<br />
  F = 59.9 and below.</p>
<h2>ATTENDANCE REGULATIONS</h2>
<p>Attendance is required and will be taken daily. 
You are expected to arrive on time to class. Repeated tardiness will 
  affect your grade: three tardies will count as one absence. Missing class will seriously hinder your ability to succeed in this class. The 
  following penalty will be applied: after three absences, your class participation 
  will be lowered one grade (from A to A-, from B+ to B, etc.) for EACH absence 
  beyond the limit. </p>
<p>
  See me as soon as possible after an absence and provide a written excuse to 
  be accepted at my discretion (in case of illness, injury, death or illness in 
  the family, university duties, court attendance, or religious observance.) </p>
<p>
  If you need to miss a class for one of the reasons listed above, let me know 
  before the class meeting, if possible. Save your absences for emergencies. <strong>Excessive 
    absences may lead to an F for the course</strong>. Upon your return to class, you are 
  responsible for all work missed and for any assignments announced during your 
  absence. I suggest that you get the name and phone number or email address of a classmate 
in the event that you are unsure of an assignment or wonder if there will be a verb quiz the day you return.</p>
<p>These policies are based on Departmental and <a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03">University Attendance Regulations</a>.</p>
<h2> PARTICIPATION</h2>
<p>The participation portion of  your grade will be determined using the following criteria and attendance requirements above. You will also have the opportunity to fill out a self-evaluation form at  the end of the semester. Reminder: phones must be silent and out of sight during class. </p>
<p>A = Student comes to class prepared, bringing proper materials, and arriving on time. Student is attentive and frequently volunteers to participate. Student is actively involved in all class activities and stays on task in group work. Any questions and comments are pertinent.</p> 
<p>B = Student is  usually prepared. Student is attentive, participates in all activities, and volunteers from time to time. Student asks only pertinent questions.</p>
<p>C= Student shows evidence of being unprepared and may do homework or text during class. Student may arrive late or leave early. Student volunteers infrequently and may ask questions that would not be necessary had the student prepared for class.</p>
<p>D = Student is unprepared and/or inattentive. Student rarely volunteers and demonstrates lack of involvement in class activities. Student may not stay on task in group work and may ask unnecessary or inappropriate questions. </p>
<p>F = Student is disrespectful and exhibits a lack of concern for the class. His or her behavior 
  may have a negative effect on the class.</p>
<h2>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY</h2>
<p>The Foreign Language Department takes the University Policy on Academic Integrity very seriously. If you do not already have the pamphlet explaining this NCSU policy, ask your advisor for one and see the <a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01">NCSU Code of Student Conduct</a>. In accordance with this policy, you will be required to sign the Honor Pledge on every exam that you take in this class. The Honor Pledge reads: &quot;I have neither given nor received any unauthorized aid on this assignment or test.&quot; In addition, please be aware that  it is my expressed expectation  that your signature on <strong>any</strong> homework assignment means that you have neither given nor received unauthorized aid.</p>
<p>Although you must complete and turn in your own work, you are encouraged to work with others in completing and preparing assignments outside of class, as well as  activities during class. Such collaboration is authorized in this class. Quizzes and tests are the principal exceptions. </p>
<p>If you work with another student or get help from a tutor, please indicate this on your assignment. For example, in class, you will put your name and your partner's on the <em>travail de classe</em>. On your homework you might write, &quot;My roommate/tutor and I worked together on this assignment.&quot;
  Copying or sharing of answers in or out of the classroom, from another student or from an answer key, without attribution, is a violation of the honor code. <span class="red">Alert</span>: If I see that you have copied from the Answer Key, you will receive a 0 on your homework and given a warning. If it happens again, you will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct. </p>
<p>Please ask me if you have any questions about these policies. Each student must fill out the <a href="110AcademicIntegrity.pdf">Academic Integrity Consent Statement</a> for me to keep on file. Do not give me any reason to be suspicious 
    of your honesty. I will report violations of Academic Integrity to the Office of Student Conduct, and the consequences can be serious. </p>
  <h2>EXAMS AND QUIZZES</h2>
  <p>There will be 5-minute verbs quizzes at the <strong>beginning</strong> of class throughout the semester, announced at the previous class meeting. There are <strong>no</strong> make-up quizzes. However, I will drop your two lowest 
  quiz grades. Here's a <a href="110Alex M003.pdf">self-test sheet</a> one student (who aced the quizzes) made to prepare. Figure out the best way to prepare and test yourself. There are also five class-long exams as well as an oral exam at midterm and a  
  final exam, all listed on the <a href="110syfa14.html">Syllabus</a>. Make-up for exams will be granted only if you are excused <strong>in advance</strong>
  with proper documentation.</p>
  <p>
    The oral part of the final exam will be given during the last week of 
  classes. </p>
<h2>HOMEWORK</h2><p>Each module of the textbook is divided into two parts: 1) White 
  Pages (<em>Th&egrave;mes, Pratiques de conversation, Perspectives 
    culturelles, &Eacute;coutons ensemble, <span class="lecture">Lecture</span>, Expression &eacute;crite</em>) and 2) <span class="green">Green</span> Pages (<em>Structures utiles</em>).</p>
 <p>Before each class, look through the white pages (column 2 of the syllabus) so you know what 
  we will be doing in class. The audio for  each Module (indicated by the speaker graphic) is included on the CDs included with the textbook as well as the <a href="http://login.cengagebrain.com">Cengage</a> web site. Listening to the exercises and the vocabulary will help you get used to hearing French. </p>
<p>The third column in the syllabus lists selected <span class="lecture"><em>Lecture: reading exercises</em></span>. There are  written exercises to  turn in listed on the syllabus (<em>Compr&eacute;hension et int&eacute;gration; Et vous? Avez-vous compris</em>?) Answers to these exercises do not appear in the Answer Key, so I will correct these for you. In the first few modules, the questions are in English, so you can answer in English. Later, the questions will be in French. If you are having trouble with these questions, try writing out the question and translating it into English. I'll correct that, too. If you are struggling with the readings, we can go over them together  during an office hour. Reading in French is an important skill you may not have practiced much before this class. </p>
<p>Your main homework is to write out the answers to exercises in the <span class="green">green</span> pages (column 4 of the syllabus). You may choose to do the even or odd <em>questions</em> for each exercise, except for <em>Tout ensemble</em>, where you should do all. It is also a good idea to translate the French words in the word bank into English before trying to do <em>Tout ensemble</em>, since it is the concluding excercise for the Module and will help ensure you know the relevant vocabulary and grammar points.</p>
<p>Check this work using Appendix B, page 485 ff. in the textbook. All exercises 
  should be corrected clearly in <span class="red">a different color</span>. If there are no errors in your homework, put a <span class="red">check mark</span> by each section so I know that you've corrected your work. When you fill in answers from the Answer Key, be sure to do so in your <span class="red">correction color</span>.  If you have questions about an exercise, write me a note on your homework. Here is a <a href="110Megan.pdf">sample</a> homework that is appropriately corrected.</p>
<p>Reminder: copying answers from the textbook or workbook answer key without trying them on your own first, is not only a waste of time (what would you learn by copying?), but also an Academic Integrity violation (see above). If you have no idea what the exercise is about, it makes sense to do one or two questions and  check the answers to see what is expected. Try your best. You will <strong>never</strong> be graded on the number of errors in your homework or workbook. Mistakes are normal when you are learning, and I expect to see mistakes and corrections on all of your homework. Revising and correcting <strong>your own</strong> errors is the best way to ensure that you do not make the same errors on a test. Helping you  learn to notice and correct your own errors is one of my  pedagogical goals in this class.</p>
<p>You will turn in the corrected 
  work from the <span class="green">green</span> pages daily and all other written assignments as
  indicated on the syllabus. Please put the page or Module section numbers at the top of each homework assignment (for example, <em>Module 1.1-1.3</em>, <em>24-27</em>).<strong> Full credit will be given only for corrected work turned in on time.</strong></p>
<p>You will also do the  exercises in the <span class="workbook">Workbook/Lab Manual</span>  corresponding to each Module. All exercises should be corrected clearly in a <span class="red">different 
  color</span>.  The answers are in the <span class="text"> Workbook Answer Key</span>. For copyright reasons, I have  posted it on our <a href="https://wolfware.ncsu.edu/">Moodle</a> site: If there are no errors, put a <span class="red">check mark</span> by each exercise so I know at a glance that you've corrected your work. Mark any sections you don't understand so that you can ask about them 
  in class or I can explain when I'm correcting your work.</p>
<p>In the first half of the <span class="workbook">Workbook</span>, you may do even or odd <em>questions</em> in each exercise, but you must do <em>each exercise</em>. Except for Module 5, you will  skip <em>Synth&egrave;se</em>, as indicated on the <a href="110syfa14.html">Syllabus</a>. In the second half of the <span class="workbook">Workbook/Lab manual</span>, you need to do <strong>all</strong> the questions.  Suggested completion dates are 
  indicated on the <a href="110syfa14.html">Syllabus,</a> however, I will not collect these exercises until the Module exam. Bring your <span class="workbook">Workbook/Lab 
    Manual</span>  to each exam so that I can give you credit for your work. You may also write  your answers on a separate sheet of paper as long as it is clearly labeled. You will 
  get full credit (10 points) for complete and corrected exercises, and partial credit (up to 5 points) for  uncorrected exercises, incomplete, or late work.</p>
<p>Listening Comprehension and Pronunciation Exercises in the <span class="workbook">Lab Manual</span> (second half of the workbook) are to be completed with the audio available online, either on the <a href="http://login.cengagebrain.com">Cengage</a> site or our <a href="https://wolfware.ncsu.edu/">Moodle</a> site.</p>
<p>In additional to the daily homework, you will also read and complete the self-correcting exercises in <span class="egsf text">English Grammar for Students of French</span>. Assigned sections for each exam are listed on the <a href="110syfa14.html">Syllabus</a>. Some chapters do not have associated exercises. Use the <a href="110EGSF-7.pdf">Review Exercises booklet</a> to find both exercises and the answer key. The completed and corrected exercises are due <strong>each exam day</strong> for full credit (5 points). </p>
<p>We will cover Modules 1-10 of <span class="text">Motifs</span> in FLF 110.</p>
<h2>WRITTEN WORK</h2>
<p>Please <strong>skip lines</strong> on all compositions and longer written assignments whether handwritten or typed.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Do</strong> use regular or online dictionaries to check gender, spelling, and find French 
      or English equivalents for individual words or idiomatic expressions (for example: to have a good time= <em>s'amuser</em>). </p><ul>
<li><a href="http://www.wordreference.com/">http://www.wordreference.com/</a> (my favorite; great for idioms)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oxfordlanguagedictionaries.com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/"> oxfordlanguagedictionaries</a> 
  (Sign-on via NCSU Libraries. Includes useful links and resources including the Dictionary Skills Resource Pack) </li>
<li>The University of Chicago site has a handy <a href="http://machaut.uchicago.edu/conjugator">French verb conjugator</a></li></ul>

<p>However, do <b>NOT</b> use online translators for complete sentences in written 
          assignments. The results are poor and will violate Academic Integrity (see above).</p>
<h2>COMPOSITIONS</h2>
<p><em>Expression &eacute;crite </em> and <em>Synth&egrave;se:</em>
  You will write a double-spaced, handwritten or word-processed composition for each Module, 
submitting a first draft and final version for each. The due date for the first 
draft is indicated on the syllabus, and there is a penalty of 5 points for late compositions. Learn to type accents on your computer. 
You will find an explanation of how to do this on the <a href="110supp.htm">Supplementary Materials</a> page (see <span class="red">Accents</span>).  </p>
<p>Drafts will be returned with <a href="110CorrectionSymbols.html">corrections</a> indicated. Beginning with Module 3, I will be giving you a grade on revised compositions. Unrevised compositions will receive a check  mark which corresponds to a 75 when I calculate the final grade.  Compositions will be graded using the <a href="110writingassessment.html">Writing Assessment Rubric</a>. </p>
<p>When you use a dictionary, make sure that your word fits the context in French. For example: the noun <span class="red">match</span> in English may correspond to <span class="red"><em>un match</em></span> in French (a sporting event) or <span class="red"><em>une allumette</em></span> (used to light a fire). Context matters. For more information about how to use a bilingual foreign language dictionary, see the link to the Dictionary Skills Resource Pack in the previous section. Reminder: do <strong>not</strong> use on-line translators for writing assignments for more than individual words or phrases. <strong>Do</strong> use your dictionary or <a href="http://www.wordreference.com/">http://www.wordreference.com/</a></p><h2>WORKBOOK AUDIO</h2>
<p>You have two options for obtaining the audio material needed

<h2>FILM</h2>
<p>You are required to watch a French film with English 
subtitles and complete a written assignment as Composition 8. The <a href="filmsheet.html">Film Study Sheet</a> should be used for this assignment. It can  also be filled out and submitted for any other French film for extra credit. There are over a dozen appropriate films  available in DH Hill Library. Plot summaries and trailers are listed on the linked <a href="110Filmsonreserve.html">web page</a>, to help you choose a film that interests you.  You can also see or rent another French film with English subtitles locally or online.  I will send you an email when there are good French films playing at local movie theatres. </p>

<h2>MUSEUM VISIT</h2>
<p>You are required to visit the <a href="http://www.ncartmuseum.org/">North Carolina Museum of Art</a> here in Raleigh and write me a 2-3 page paper, in English or French, about your visit. Please choose at least two works of art  to focus on. Share your impressions of the museum overall, as well. This paper, which has the same weight as three homework assignments, may be turned in anytime during the semester, but must be turned in by your Final Oral  Exam, during the last week of classes. As part of the midterm and final oral exams, you will be reponsible for presenting and discussing art works in the NCMA collection in French. For the midterm oral exam, choose <strong>any portrait</strong> in the Museum's collection to present, and for the oral part of the final exam, you will choose any work by<strong> a French artist</strong>. Details are included on the <a href="110NCMA.html">NCMA-110 Assignment page</a>. You may visit the museum on your own or at one of the daily guided tours. I will also organize an optional group tour for our class with transportation provided if needed. See the <a href="110syfa14.html">Syllabus</a> for date and time. </p>
<h2>SERVICE LEARNING</h2>
<p>In January 2011, the French business school <a href="http://www.skema.edu/en/usa">SKEMA</a>  opened a new campus at NCSU. A class has been created to help these students acclimate to and learn about North Carolina and the US. As a student of French, you have a unique opportunity to participate in the small-discussion group component of the class and benefit intellectually, professionally, and culturally. As an incentive, students who successfully complete this program will receive 2 extra credit points towards their final grade in FLF 110. See <a href="http://go.ncsu.edu/ICLP">http://go.ncsu.edu/ICLP</a> for more information. You will also partcipate in a  Building Friendships intercultural workshop on October 3, as part of class, with students from SKEMA.</p>
<h2>EXTRA CREDIT</h2>
<p>Do the <a href="Type/ExtraCreditType.html">Extra Credit Assignment on <em>Myers-Briggs Type in College</em></a> to learn more about your learning preferences. This is due in the first month of class. </p>
<p>If your homework is complete, you can also earn extra credit towards your participation grade 
  by  turning in supplementary assignments related to our class work, such as translating 
  the songs we listen to in class, doing additional reading or writing assignments in the text book, cooking a French meal and writing about it, seeing French films 
  or art exhibits. The exercises in the text book called <em>Explorez en ligne</em> are also great extra-credit assignments.Write me (in English or French) about what you see and learn. The Service Learning project with SKEMA (see above) will earn you 2 points on your final grade. </p>

<h2>COURSE EVALUATIONS</h2>
<p>Online class evaluations will be available for students to complete in the final weeks of the semester. Students will receive an email message directing them to a website where they can login using their Unity ID and complete evaluations.  All evaluations are confidential; instructors will never know how any one student responded to any question, and students will never know the ratings for any particular instructors.<br />

<h2>TUTORING ASSISTANCE</h2>
<p>Please see me right away if you are experiencing problems or if reasonable accommodation

<p><strong>SUPPORTING FELLOW STUDENTS IN DISTRESS<br />
</strong><br />
As members of the NC State Wolfpack community, we each share a personal responsibility to express concern for one another and to ensure that this classroom and the campus as a whole remains a safe environment for learning. &nbsp;Occasionally, you may come across a fellow classmate whose personal behavior concerns or worries you. When this is the case, I would encourage you to report this behavior to the NC State Students of Concern website:<a href="http://studentsofconcern.ncsu.edu/" target="_blank">http://studentsofconcern.ncsu.edu</a>/. &nbsp;Although you can report anonymously, it is preferred that you share your contact information so they can follow-up with you personally.</p>
<h2>STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES</h2>
<p>For all students currently registered with 
  the  Disability Services for Students (DSO), an accommodation letter 
  will be sent to the instructor. This letter verifies that appropriate documentation 
  is on file and that the student has a substantiated disability requiring effective 
  reasonable accommodations. Any student requesting accommodations for whom a 
  letter has not been written must see a DSO service provider.</p>
<p>Students with disabilities, for whom a letter of accommodation has been sent 
  from the DSO office to the instructor, should schedule an appointment with the 
  instructor immediately.
  DSO information can be found at their web site at
  <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/dso">http://www.ncsu.edu/dso</a> or call the office directly at 919 515-7653.</p>

<p class="style1">&quot;<strong>Five Stages of Grief&quot;</strong>, a model introduced by Elisabeth K&uuml;bler-Ross in her 1969 book <em>On Death and Dying</em>. <br />
  The stages are:<br />
  Denial: &quot;I feel fine.&quot;; &quot;This can't be happening.&quot; 'Not to me!&quot;<br />
  Anger: &quot;Why me? It's not fair!&quot; <br />
  Bargaining: &quot;Just let me live to see my children graduate.&quot; <br />
  Depression: &quot;I'm so sad, why bother with anything?&quot;; &quot;I'm going to die . . . What's the point?&quot;<br />
  Acceptance:<br />
  &quot;It's going to be OK.&quot;; &quot;I can't fight it, I may as well prepare for it.&quot;<br />

<p class="style1">Other quotes by Elizabeth Kubler-Ross</p>
<p class="style1">&quot;Our concern must be to live while we're alive... to release our inner selves from the spiritual death that comes with living behind a facade designed to conform to external definitions of who and what we are.&quot;</p>
<p class="style1">&ldquo;People are like stained glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in; their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="style1">&quot;I have never met a person whose greatest need was anything other than real, unconditional love. You can find it in a simple act of kindness toward someone who needs help. There is no mistaking love. You feel it in your heart. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. It is our connection to God and to each other. &quot;<br />

<h2>DID I MISS ANYTHING?</h2>
<p>Tom Wayman (p.37-39, in <em>Poetry 180</em>, edited by Billy Collins, Random House, 2003)</p>
<p>Nothing. When we realized you weren't here <br />
  we sat with our hands folded on our desks <br />
  in silence, for the full two hours</p>
<p>Everything, I gave an exam worth <br />
  40 percent of the grade for this term <br />
  and assigned some reading due today <br />
  on which I'm about to hand out a quiz <br />
  worth 50 percent</p>
<p>Nothing. None of the contents of this course <br />
  has value or meaning<br />
  Take as many days off as you like: <br />
  any activities we undertake as a class<br />
  I assure you will not matter either to you or me <br />
  and are without purpose</p>
<p>Everything. A few minutes after we began last time <br />
  A shaft of light suddenly descended and an angel <br />
  or other heavenly being appeared<br />
  and revealed to us what each woman or man must do <br />
  to attain divine wisdom in this life and<br />
  the hereafter<br />
  This is the last time the class will meet<br />
  before we dispense to bring the good news to all people <br />
  on earth</p>
<p>Nothing. When you are not present <br />
  how could something significant occur?</p>
<p>Everything. Contained in this classroom <br />
  is a microcosm of human experience <br />
  assembled for you to query and examine and ponder <br />
  This is not the only place such an opportunity has been gathered</p>
<p>but it was one place</p>
<p>And you weren't here</p>

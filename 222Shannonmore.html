<p>More details about Shannon's 4 Questions from <em>The Prentice Hall Pocket Guide to Writing About Literature</em>, 2002<br />
  <br />
<strong>What is confusing?</strong><br />
[W]hat is it about this particular text that we are having trouble with? Is it the diction? Are there words we do not recognize or that are being used in an unfamiliar way? Is it the author's style? Is this text written in an experimental style? Is it possible that the author wants the readers to be a little confused at a certain point in the text? Is there something about the setting that we need to know?…Was the text written at some point in the recent or distant past? Are we missing what the author assumed would be some obvious topical references? (27)<br />
</p>
<p><strong>What is repeated?</strong></p>
<p>Look for any pattern: a key word that is repeated, a kind of imagery that shows up more than once, patterns of character behavior, recurring names, similar settings or activities associated with some character mentioned in the work. (29)</p>
<p><strong>What is familiar?</strong></p>
<p>The writer may be repeating something that has already occured in the work or because the writer is evoking some element that almost always occurs in a certain genre of writing, or because the author is making an allusion to some text or event. (37) Another &quot;familiar face&quot; we might search for [is an] archetype. Archetypes allow us to tell the same stories again and again, with minor changes of location and character names, of course, but the stories do not change much: the young hero learns to be selfless, the courageous explorer goes where no man has gone before, the forces of good square off against the forces of evil… (39)</p>
<p><strong>What is strange?</strong><br />
  [W]hen you are reading a literary work, and something jumps off the page at you and strikes you as being different from the rest of the text or as being different from similar texts…this may be a spot where the author is experimenting…If a writer takes such a risk, there may well be something of particular value.<br />

<p class="style1"><strong><span class="style2"> INTJ</span>: Introverted Intuition with Thinking </strong><br />
  <br />
  INTJ types have independent, original ideas. Although INTJ types do not occur frequently in the general population, they appear in greater numbers in college and graduate school. They use analysis and skepticism to further their goals. They value competence in themselves and others and work hard to achieve it. <br />
  <br />

  &bull;

  &bull;
  Often found in sciences, engineering, politics, philosophy; college teaching, and research <br />
  <span class="style4"><br />

  &bull;
  Study best alone  <br />
&bull;  Report that they study up to thirty hours each week  <br />
&bull;
Write quickly, stating a popular position, then challenging it <br />
&bull; Need to revise first drafts by softening overly firm statements, filling in missing facts, and providing human examples <br />
<br />
  <span class="style4">Playing</span> <br />
  &bull; Prefer lectures, drama, and music for extracurricular time <br />
 &bull; Prefer a neat roommate who is serious about academics  <br />
 &bull;

 &bull;
 Even when playing, tend to set high performance standards <br />
 <br />

  &bull;
May offend others with their critiques or bluntness<br />
&bull;
May attempt to master all subjects they are interested in <br />
&bull;
May not share feelings even with close friends <br />
<br />
  <span class="style4">Dealing with Stress </span><br />
&bull; Naturally gets things organized  <br />
&bull;
May need help learning how to relate intimately to others <br />
&bull;
Must learn to relax without striving <br />
&bull;
Need to learn to express appreciation<br />
&bull;
Must work to involve others in their personal lives <br />

  &quot;Past exonerative&quot; from Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_exonerative) <br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  The &quot;past exonerative tense&quot; is a witticism coined by William Schneider of the New York Times to describe the rhetorical tactic of speaking in the passive voice in order to distance oneself from blame. The tactic is most famous for being invoked by politicians.<br />
  The classic example of this usage was the 1986 utterance of &quot;Clearly, mistakes were made...&quot; by then president Ronald Reagan to describe the actions of officials in his administration during the Iran-contra affair, who sold arms to Iran to fund rebels in Nicaragua.<br />
  Other instances can be found in statements by Bill Clinton, Alberto Gonzales, John E. Sununu, and George W. Bush, among others.</span></p>
<p class="style4">&bull; <strong>Rousseau on nature</strong> (a few examples from our two selections) <br />
If you want right guidance, always follow the leadings of nature.<br />
By the very law of nature women are at the mercy of men's judgments both for themselves and for their children.<br />
Everything that checks and constrains nature is in bad taste.<br />
Whether Nature did well or ill in breaking the mold in which she formed me, is a question which can only be resolved after the reading of my book.</p>

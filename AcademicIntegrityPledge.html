<p><span class="style1"><span class="style2">Academic Integrity Consent Statement </span></span></p>
<p class="style1"><span class="style1">The NC State University Student Handbook has a section called the Code of Student Conduct. This section defines academic integrity, academic dishonesty, cheating, and plagiarism. </span></p>
<p class="style1"><span class="style1">DIRECTIONS: (1) Read through this statement carefully. (2) Ask questions if there is anything you do not understand. (3) Print out a copy of this sheet and sign it. (4) Return it to me.</span></p>
<p class="style1"><span class="style1">I have heard the teacher's discussion of plagiarism, and viewed this <a href="https://studentconduct.dasa.ncsu.edu/academic-integrity-overview/">page</a> on the NCSU Student Conduct site.</span></p>
<p class="style1"><span class="style1">I understand that I must use research conventions to cite and clearly mark other people's ideas and words within my assignments. I understand that plagiarism is an act of intellectual dishonesty. I understand it is academically unethical and unacceptable to do any of the following acts:</span></p>
<p class="style1"><span class="style1">To submit an essay written in whole or in part by another student as if it were my own.<br />
  To download an essay from the internet, then quote or paraphrase from it, in whole or in part, without acknowledging the original source.<br />
  To restate a clever phrase verbatim from another writer without acknowledging the source.<br />
  To paraphrase part of another writer's work without acknowledging the source.<br />
  To reproduce the substance of another writer's argument without acknowledging the source.<br />
  To take work originally done for one instructor's assignment and re-submit it to another teacher.<br />
  To cheat on tests or quizzes through the use of crib sheets, hidden notes, viewing another student's paper, revealing the answers on my own paper to another student through verbal or textual communication, sign language, or other means of storing and communicating information--including electronic devices, recording devices, cellular telephones, headsets, and portable computers.<br />
  To copy another student's homework and submit the work as if it were the product of my own labor.<br />
  <br />
  I understand that the consequences for committing any of the previous acts of academic dishonesty can include a failing grade for the assignment or quiz, failure in the class as a whole, and even expulsion from the university. I will not plagiarize or cheat.</span></p>
<p><span class="style1"><span class="style1">Pledge: I have read and understand the above statements and agree to abide by the standards of academic integrity in the North Carolina State University Code of Student Conduct and Regulation.</span></span></p>

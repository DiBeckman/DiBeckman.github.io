    <font color="#FF0000">I. INTRODUCTION</font><br>
    <br>
    <font color="#003300">A. Reading the text</font><br>
    <br>
    1. Read the text out loud several times, paying attention to its difficulties 
    (words, expressions, grammar).<br>
    <br>
    2. Ask yourself at this point some general questions about the text. Is it 
    is comic, serious; a monologue, dialog (slow or rapid); is it a description, 
    reflection, confession, etc?<br>
    <br>
    3. Try to find the rhythm of the text: slow, rapid, even, uneven.<br>
    <br>
    4. The purpose of this reading is to make your first concrete observations 
    about the form and content of the text. You should get a sense of the natural 
    tone of the text, the unity or variety of its ideas or expressed feelings.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#003300">B. Examine the difficult parts of the text.</font><br>
    <br>
    1. What do the difficult words and sentences mean? Remember that there may 
    be more than one meaning intended.<br>
    <br>
    2. What do the images (colors, forms, abstractions) and literary, historical, 
    and/or mythological allusions mean? Identify the figures of speech and thought used. See </font><font color="#990000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#000000"><em>Web sites about Figures of Speech</em></font></font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> on the <a href="222supmatf04.html">Supplementary Materials</a> page (added 8/21/05). </font><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    <br>
    <font color="#003300">C. Examine the difficult technical aspects.</font><br>
    <br>
    1. Grammatical structures.<br>
    <br>
    2. Sentence or verse structures.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF0000">II. PRESENTATION OF THE TEXT</font><br>
    <br>
    <font color="#003300">A. Identification and situation. (Not necessary for 
    in-class expos&eacute;)</font><br>
    <br>
    1. Briefly situate the text and its author historically.<br>
    <br>
    a. Who is the author?<br>
    <br>
    b. When was the text written?<br>
    <br>
    c. In what circumstances was the text written?<br>
    <br>
    2. The only information you need to present is that which applies directly 
    to the text in question.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#003300">B. Preliminaries.</font><br>
    <br>
    1. Make an outline of the text to establish its principal divisions.<br>
    <br>
    2. Briefly indicate the main idea of the text: what is it about?<br>
    <br>
    3. When appropriate, situate your passage within the plot of the entire work 
    which is being studied.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF0000">III. EXAMINATION OF THE TEXT: Form 
    and Content</font><br>
    <br>
    A. This part consists of a detailed analysis of the text: examine the ideas 
    (content) and style (form) of the passage in order to show what the author 
    says and how he says it.<br>
    <br>
    B. Use citations from the text as often as necessary to illustrate and reinforce 
    your observations.<br>
    <br>
    C. What is the effect on the reader of this particular manner of presentation? 
    Each word, clause, image, sound--nearly every element of the text--can suggest 
    a question, and your answers to these questions will help you appreciate the 
    qualities of the text. Do the ideas and style reinforce each other or are 
    they at odds? Are they serious, elevated, playful, coherent, disturbing? <br>
    <br>
    D. Establish the most important themes that arise from the ideas and style 
    of your text.<br>
    <font color="#FF0000"><br>
    IV. CONCLUSION</font><br>
    <br>
    <font color="#003300">A. Evaluation</font><br>
    <br>
    1. Summarize the main points of your analysis.<br>
    <br>
    2. What are the original or special qualities of the text? Consider both form 
    and content.<br>
    <font color="#003300"><br>
    B. Interpretation</font><br>
    How does your passage fit in thematically with the work as a whole? What significant 
    or essential aspects of the work does it contain or emphasize? What have we 
    learned about the characters and their situation? You may also present your 
    personal interpretation.</font></p>

  The composition.</font> Is the arrangement classical (clear, ordered, logical, 
  methodical, rigid) or non-classical (anthithetical, illogical, unevenly balanced). 
  Is there progression or opposition in the different parts of the text; 
  is there contrast, repetition, order or disorder?<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#FF0000">The style.</font> Is it consistent, varied, rich, full 
  of images; static, dynamic concise, rapid, life-like? Are the words technical, 
  picturesque, simple, erudite, subtle, varied? Are the words and the passage 
  as a whole obscure, confusing, unobtrusive, concrete, abstract, realistic?<br>

  fairy tales, mythology, the fantastic, history, folklore?<br>
  <font color="#FF0000"><br>

  clauses), circular, rapid, slow? When read aloud is the passage musical or dissonant; 
  fluid or heavy; discreet, vehement; simple or oratorical? Is the rhythm smooth 
  or choppy, varied, monotonous or majestic?<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#FF0000">The effect on the reader</font>. How is the reader's interest 
  held? Is the passage consistent in tone, dramatic, suspenseful, anticlimactic?

  <br>
  <font color="#FF0000">How does it do this?</font> Lightnesss, reason, seriousness, eloquence, sensorial evocations, humor, irony, 
  absurdity, poetry, exageration, parody, understatement?<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#FF0000">Evaluation</font>. Is there a moral intention? Is the 
  text essentially poetic, didactic, comic, tragic, or sentimental? Is there an 
  underlying philosophy or point of view? Or is it art for art's sake, that is, 
  existing only as art?<br>

The Women&rsquo;s Crusade</p>
<p>By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF and SHERYL WuDUNN<br />
  IN THE 19TH CENTURY, the paramount moral challenge was slavery. In the 20th century, it was totalitarianism. In this century, it is the brutality inflicted on so many women and girls around the globe: sex trafficking, acid attacks, bride burnings and mass rape.</p>
<p>Yet if the injustices that women in poor countries suffer are of paramount importance, in an economic and geopolitical sense the opportunity they represent is even greater. &ldquo;Women hold up half the sky,&rdquo; in the words of a Chinese saying, yet that&rsquo;s mostly an aspiration: in a large slice of the world, girls are uneducated and women marginalized, and it&rsquo;s not an accident that those same countries are disproportionately mired in poverty and riven by fundamentalism and chaos. There&rsquo;s a growing recognition among everyone from the World Bank to the U.S. military&rsquo;s Joint Chiefs of Staff to aid organizations like CARE that focusing on women and girls is the most effective way to fight global poverty and extremism. That&rsquo;s why foreign aid is increasingly directed to women. The world is awakening to a powerful truth: Women and girls aren&rsquo;t the problem; they&rsquo;re the solution.</p>
<p>One place to observe this alchemy of gender is in the muddy back alleys of Pakistan. In a slum outside the grand old city of Lahore, a woman named Saima Muhammad used to dissolve into tears every evening. A round-faced woman with thick black hair tucked into a head scarf, Saima had barely a rupee, and her deadbeat husband was unemployed and not particularly employable. He was frustrated and angry, and he coped by beating Saima each afternoon. Their house was falling apart, and Saima had to send her young daughter to live with an aunt, because there wasn&rsquo;t enough food to go around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sister-in-law made fun of me, saying, &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t even feed your children,&rsquo; &rdquo; recalled Saima when Nick met her two years ago on a trip to Pakistan. &ldquo;My husband beat me up. My brother-in-law beat me up. I had an awful life.&rdquo; Saima&rsquo;s husband accumulated a debt of more than $3,000, and it seemed that these loans would hang over the family for generations. Then when Saima&rsquo;s second child was born and turned out to be a girl as well, her mother-in-law, a harsh, blunt woman named Sharifa Bibi, raised the stakes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not going to have a son,&rdquo; Sharifa told Saima&rsquo;s husband, in front of her. &ldquo;So you should marry again. Take a second wife.&rdquo; Saima was shattered and ran off sobbing. Another wife would leave even less money to feed and educate the children. And Saima herself would be marginalized in the household, cast off like an old sock. For days Saima walked around in a daze, her eyes red; the slightest incident would send her collapsing into hysterical tears.</p>
<p>It was at that point that Saima signed up with the Kashf Foundation, a Pakistani microfinance organization that lends tiny amounts of money to poor women to start businesses. Kashf is typical of microfinance institutions, in that it lends almost exclusively to women, in groups of 25. The women guarantee one another&rsquo;s debts and meet every two weeks to make payments and discuss a social issue, like family planning or schooling for girls. A Pakistani woman is often forbidden to leave the house without her husband&rsquo;s permission, but husbands tolerate these meetings because the women return with cash and investment ideas.</p>
<p>Saima took out a $65 loan and used the money to buy beads and cloth, which she transformed into beautiful embroidery that she then sold to merchants in the markets of Lahore. She used the profit to buy more beads and cloth, and soon she had an embroidery business and was earning a solid income &mdash; the only one in her household to do so. Saima took her elder daughter back from the aunt and began paying off her husband&rsquo;s debt.</p>
<p>When merchants requested more embroidery than Saima could produce, she paid neighbors to assist her. Eventually 30 families were working for her, and she put her husband to work as well &mdash; &ldquo;under my direction,&rdquo; she explained with a twinkle in her eye. Saima became the tycoon of the neighborhood, and she was able to pay off her husband&rsquo;s entire debt, keep her daughters in school, renovate the house, connect running water and buy a television.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now everyone comes to me to borrow money, the same ones who used to criticize me,&rdquo; Saima said, beaming in satisfaction. &ldquo;And the children of those who used to criticize me now come to my house to watch TV.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Today, Saima is a bit plump and displays a gold nose ring as well as several other rings and bracelets on each wrist. She exudes self-confidence as she offers a grand tour of her home and work area, ostentatiously showing off the television and the new plumbing. She doesn&rsquo;t even pretend to be subordinate to her husband. He spends his days mostly loafing around, occasionally helping with the work but always having to accept orders from his wife. He has become more impressed with females in general: Saima had a third child, also a girl, but now that&rsquo;s not a problem. &ldquo;Girls are just as good as boys,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>Saima&rsquo;s new prosperity has transformed the family&rsquo;s educational prospects. She is planning to send all three of her daughters through high school and maybe to college as well. She brings in tutors to improve their schoolwork, and her oldest child, Javaria, is ranked first in her class. We asked Javaria what she wanted to be when she grew up, thinking she might aspire to be a doctor or lawyer. Javaria cocked her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to do embroidery,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>As for her husband, Saima said, &ldquo;We have a good relationship now.&rdquo; She explained, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t fight, and he treats me well.&rdquo; And what about finding another wife who might bear him a son? Saima chuckled at the question: &ldquo;Now nobody says anything about that.&rdquo; Sharifa Bibi, the mother-in-law, looked shocked when we asked whether she wanted her son to take a second wife to bear a son. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Saima is bringing so much to this house. . . . She puts a roof over our heads and food on the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sharifa even allows that Saima is now largely exempt from beatings by her husband. &ldquo;A woman should know her limits, and if not, then it&rsquo;s her husband&rsquo;s right to beat her,&rdquo; Sharifa said. &ldquo;But if a woman earns more than her husband, it&rsquo;s difficult for him to discipline her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>WHAT SHOULD we make of stories like Saima&rsquo;s? Traditionally, the status of women was seen as a &ldquo;soft&rdquo; issue &mdash; worthy but marginal. We initially reflected that view ourselves in our work as journalists. We preferred to focus instead on the &ldquo;serious&rdquo; international issues, like trade disputes or arms proliferation. Our awakening came in China.</p>
<p>After we married in 1988, we moved to Beijing to be correspondents for The New York Times. Seven months later we found ourselves standing on the edge of Tiananmen Square watching troops fire their automatic weapons at prodemocracy protesters. The massacre claimed between 400 and 800 lives and transfixed the world; wrenching images of the killings appeared constantly on the front page and on television screens.</p>
<p>Yet the following year we came across an obscure but meticulous demographic study that outlined a human rights violation that had claimed tens of thousands more lives. This study found that 39,000 baby girls died annually in China because parents didn&rsquo;t give them the same medical care and attention that boys received &mdash; and that was just in the first year of life. A result is that as many infant girls died unnecessarily every week in China as protesters died at Tiananmen Square. Those Chinese girls never received a column inch of news coverage, and we began to wonder if our journalistic priorities were skewed.</p>
<p>A similar pattern emerged in other countries. In India, a &ldquo;bride burning&rdquo; takes place approximately once every two hours, to punish a woman for an inadequate dowry or to eliminate her so a man can remarry &mdash; but these rarely constitute news. When a prominent dissident was arrested in China, we would write a front-page article; when 100,000 girls were kidnapped and trafficked into brothels, we didn&rsquo;t even consider it news.</p>
<p>Amartya Sen, the ebullient Nobel Prize-winning economist, developed a gauge of gender inequality that is a striking reminder of the stakes involved. &ldquo;More than 100 million women are missing,&rdquo; Sen wrote in a classic essay in 1990 in The New York Review of Books, spurring a new field of research. Sen noted that in normal circumstances, women live longer than men, and so there are more females than males in much of the world. Yet in places where girls have a deeply unequal status, they vanish. China has 107 males for every 100 females in its overall population (and an even greater disproportion among newborns), and India has 108. The implication of the sex ratios, Sen later found, is that about 107 million females are missing from the globe today. Follow-up studies have calculated the number slightly differently, deriving alternative figures for &ldquo;missing women&rdquo; of between 60 million and 107 million.</p>
<p>Girls vanish partly because they don&rsquo;t get the same health care and food as boys. In India, for example, girls are less likely to be vaccinated than boys and are taken to the hospital only when they are sicker. A result is that girls in India from 1 to 5 years of age are 50 percent more likely to die than boys their age. In addition, ultrasound machines have allowed a pregnant woman to find out the sex of her fetus &mdash; and then get an abortion if it is female.</p>
<p>The global statistics on the abuse of girls are numbing. It appears that more girls and women are now missing from the planet, precisely because they are female, than men were killed on the battlefield in all the wars of the 20th century. The number of victims of this routine &ldquo;gendercide&rdquo; far exceeds the number of people who were slaughtered in all the genocides of the 20th century.</p>
<p>For those women who live, mistreatment is sometimes shockingly brutal. If you&rsquo;re reading this article, the phrase &ldquo;gender discrimination&rdquo; might conjure thoughts of unequal pay, underfinanced sports teams or unwanted touching from a boss. In the developing world, meanwhile, millions of women and girls are actually enslaved. While a precise number is hard to pin down, the International Labor Organization, a U.N. agency, estimates that at any one time there are 12.3 million people engaged in forced labor of all kinds, including sexual servitude. In Asia alone about one million children working in the sex trade are held in conditions indistinguishable from slavery, according to a U.N. report. Girls and women are locked in brothels and beaten if they resist, fed just enough to be kept alive and often sedated with drugs &mdash; to pacify them and often to cultivate addiction. India probably has more modern slaves than any other country.</p>
<p>Another huge burden for women in poor countries is maternal mortality, with one woman dying in childbirth around the world every minute. In the West African country Niger, a woman stands a one-in-seven chance of dying in childbirth at some point in her life. (These statistics are all somewhat dubious, because maternal mortality isn&rsquo;t considered significant enough to require good data collection.) For all of India&rsquo;s shiny new high-rises, a woman there still has a 1-in-70 lifetime chance of dying in childbirth. In contrast, the lifetime risk in the United States is 1 in 4,800; in Ireland, it is 1 in 47,600. The reason for the gap is not that we don&rsquo;t know how to save lives of women in poor countries. It&rsquo;s simply that poor, uneducated women in Africa and Asia have never been a priority either in their own countries or to donor nations.</p>
<p>ABBAS BE, A BEAUTIFUL teenage girl in the Indian city of Hyderabad, has chocolate skin, black hair and gleaming white teeth &mdash; and a lovely smile, which made her all the more marketable.</p>
<p>Money was tight in her family, so when she was about 14 she arranged to take a job as a maid in the capital, New Delhi. Instead, she was locked up in a brothel, beaten with a cricket bat, gang-raped and told that she would have to cater to customers. Three days after she arrived, Abbas and all 70 girls in the brothel were made to gather round and watch as the pimps made an example of one teenage girl who had fought customers. The troublesome girl was stripped naked, hogtied, humiliated and mocked, beaten savagely and then stabbed in the stomach until she bled to death in front of Abbas and the others.</p>
<p>Abbas was never paid for her work. Any sign of dissatisfaction led to a beating or worse; two more times, she watched girls murdered by the brothel managers for resisting. Eventually Abbas was freed by police and taken back to Hyderabad. She found a home in a shelter run by Prajwala, an organization that takes in girls rescued from brothels and teaches them new skills. Abbas is acquiring an education and has learned to be a bookbinder; she also counsels other girls about how to avoid being trafficked. As a skilled bookbinder, Abbas is able to earn a decent living, and she is now helping to put her younger sisters through school as well. With an education, they will be far less vulnerable to being trafficked. Abbas has moved from being a slave to being a producer, contributing to India&rsquo;s economic development and helping raise her family.</p>
<p>Perhaps the lesson presented by both Abbas and Saima is the same: In many poor countries, the greatest unexploited resource isn&rsquo;t oil fields or veins of gold; it is the women and girls who aren&rsquo;t educated and never become a major presence in the formal economy. With education and with help starting businesses, impoverished women can earn money and support their countries as well as their families. They represent perhaps the best hope for fighting global poverty.</p>
<p>In East Asia, as we saw in our years of reporting there, women have already benefited from deep social changes. In countries like South Korea and Malaysia, China and Thailand, rural girls who previously contributed negligibly to the economy have gone to school and received educations, giving them the autonomy to move to the city to hold factory jobs. This hugely increased the formal labor force; when the women then delayed childbearing, there was a demographic dividend to the country as well. In the 1990s, by our estimations, some 80 percent of the employees on the assembly lines in coastal China were female, and the proportion across the manufacturing belt of East Asia was at least 70 percent.</p>
<p>The hours were long and the conditions wretched, just as in the sweatshops of the Industrial Revolution in the West. But peasant women were making money, sending it back home and sometimes becoming the breadwinners in their families. They gained new skills that elevated their status. Westerners encounter sweatshops and see exploitation, and indeed, many of these plants are just as bad as critics say. But it&rsquo;s sometimes said in poor countries that the only thing worse than being exploited in a sweatshop is not being exploited in a sweatshop. Low-wage manufacturing jobs disproportionately benefited women in countries like China because these were jobs for which brute physical force was not necessary and women&rsquo;s nimbleness gave them an advantage over men &mdash; which was not the case with agricultural labor or construction or other jobs typically available in poor countries. Strange as it may seem, sweatshops in Asia had the effect of empowering women. One hundred years ago, many women in China were still having their feet bound. Today, while discrimination and inequality and harassment persist, the culture has been transformed. In the major cities, we&rsquo;ve found that Chinese men often do more domestic chores than American men typically do. And urban parents are often not only happy with an only daughter; they may even prefer one, under the belief that daughters are better than sons at looking after aging parents.</p>
<p>WHY DO MICROFINANCE organizations usually focus their assistance on women? And why does everyone benefit when women enter the work force and bring home regular pay checks? One reason involves the dirty little secret of global poverty: some of the most wretched suffering is caused not just by low incomes but also by unwise spending by the poor &mdash; especially by men. Surprisingly frequently, we&rsquo;ve come across a mother mourning a child who has just died of malaria for want of a $5 mosquito bed net; the mother says that the family couldn&rsquo;t afford a bed net and she means it, but then we find the father at a nearby bar. He goes three evenings a week to the bar, spending $5 each week.</p>
<p>Our interviews and perusal of the data available suggest that the poorest families in the world spend approximately 10 times as much (20 percent of their incomes on average) on a combination of alcohol, prostitution, candy, sugary drinks and lavish feasts as they do on educating their children (2 percent). If poor families spent only as much on educating their children as they do on beer and prostitutes, there would be a breakthrough in the prospects of poor countries. Girls, since they are the ones kept home from school now, would be the biggest beneficiaries. Moreover, one way to reallocate family expenditures in this way is to put more money in the hands of women. A series of studies has found that when women hold assets or gain incomes, family money is more likely to be spent on nutrition, medicine and housing, and consequently children are healthier.</p>
<p>In Ivory Coast, one research project examined the different crops that men and women grow for their private kitties: men grow coffee, cocoa and pineapple, and women grow plantains, bananas, coconuts and vegetables. Some years the &ldquo;men&rsquo;s crops&rdquo; have good harvests and the men are flush with cash, and other years it is the women who prosper. Money is to some extent shared. But even so, the economist Esther Duflo of M.I.T. found that when the men&rsquo;s crops flourish, the household spends more money on alcohol and tobacco. When the women have a good crop, the households spend more money on food. &ldquo;When women command greater power, child health and nutrition improves,&rdquo; Duflo says.</p>
<p>Such research has concrete implications: for example, donor countries should nudge poor countries to adjust their laws so that when a man dies, his property is passed on to his widow rather than to his brothers. Governments should make it easy for women to hold property and bank accounts &mdash; 1 percent of the world&rsquo;s landowners are women &mdash; and they should make it much easier for microfinance institutions to start banks so that women can save money.</p>
<p>OF COURSE, IT&rsquo;S FAIR to ask: empowering women is well and good, but can one do this effectively? Does foreign aid really work? William Easterly, an economist at New York University, has argued powerfully that shoveling money at poor countries accomplishes little. Some Africans, including Dambisa Moyo, author of &ldquo;Dead Aid,&rdquo; have said the same thing. The critics note that there has been no correlation between amounts of aid going to countries and their economic growth rates.</p>
<p>Our take is that, frankly, there is something to these criticisms. Helping people is far harder than it looks. Aid experiments often go awry, or small successes turn out to be difficult to replicate or scale up. Yet we&rsquo;ve also seen, anecdotally and in the statistics, evidence that some kinds of aid have been enormously effective. The delivery of vaccinations and other kinds of health care has reduced the number of children who die every year before they reach the age of 5 to less than 10 million today from 20 million in 1960.</p>
<p>In general, aid appears to work best when it is focused on health, education and microfinance (although microfinance has been somewhat less successful in Africa than in Asia). And in each case, crucially, aid has often been most effective when aimed at women and girls; when policy wonks do the math, they often find that these investments have a net economic return. Only a small proportion of aid specifically targets women or girls, but increasingly donors are recognizing that that is where they often get the most bang for the buck.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, the United Nations and the World Bank began to proclaim the potential resource that women and girls represent. &ldquo;Investment in girls&rsquo; education may well be the highest-return investment available in the developing world,&rdquo; Larry Summers wrote when he was chief economist of the World Bank. Private aid groups and foundations shifted gears as well. &ldquo;Women are the key to ending hunger in Africa,&rdquo; declared the Hunger Project. The Center for Global Development issued a major report explaining &ldquo;why and how to put girls at the center of development.&rdquo; CARE took women and girls as the centerpiece of its anti-poverty efforts. &ldquo;Gender inequality hurts economic growth,&rdquo; Goldman Sachs concluded in a 2008 research report that emphasized how much developing countries could improve their economic performance by educating girls.</p>
<p>Bill Gates recalls once being invited to speak in Saudi Arabia and finding himself facing a segregated audience. Four-fifths of the listeners were men, on the left. The remaining one-fifth were women, all covered in black cloaks and veils, on the right. A partition separated the two groups. Toward the end, in the question-and-answer session, a member of the audience noted that Saudi Arabia aimed to be one of the Top 10 countries in the world in technology by 2010 and asked if that was realistic. &ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re not fully utilizing half the talent in the country,&rdquo; Gates said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not going to get too close to the Top 10.&rdquo; The small group on the right erupted in wild cheering.</p>
<p>Policy makers have gotten the message as well. President Obama has appointed a new White House Council on Women and Girls. Perhaps he was indoctrinated by his mother, who was one of the early adopters of microloans to women when she worked to fight poverty in Indonesia. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is a member of the White House Council, and she has also selected a talented activist, Melanne Verveer, to direct a new State Department Office of Global Women&rsquo;s Issues. On Capitol Hill, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has put Senator Barbara Boxer in charge of a new subcommittee that deals with women&rsquo;s issues.</p>
<p>Yet another reason to educate and empower women is that greater female involvement in society and the economy appears to undermine extremism and terrorism. It has long been known that a risk factor for turbulence and violence is the share of a country&rsquo;s population made up of young people. Now it is emerging that male domination of society is also a risk factor; the reasons aren&rsquo;t fully understood, but it may be that when women are marginalized the nation takes on the testosterone-laden culture of a military camp or a high-school boys&rsquo; locker room. That&rsquo;s in part why the Joint Chiefs of Staff and international security specialists are puzzling over how to increase girls&rsquo; education in countries like Afghanistan &mdash; and why generals have gotten briefings from Greg Mortenson, who wrote about building girls&rsquo; schools in his best seller, &ldquo;Three Cups of Tea.&rdquo; Indeed, some scholars say they believe the reason Muslim countries have been disproportionately afflicted by terrorism is not Islamic teachings about infidels or violence but rather the low levels of female education and participation in the labor force.</p>
<p>SO WHAT WOULD an agenda for fighting poverty through helping women look like? You might begin with the education of girls &mdash; which doesn&rsquo;t just mean building schools. There are other innovative means at our disposal. A study in Kenya by Michael Kremer, a Harvard economist, examined six different approaches to improving educational performance, from providing free textbooks to child-sponsorship programs. The approach that raised student test scores the most was to offer girls who had scored in the top 15 percent of their class on sixth-grade tests a $19 scholarship for seventh and eighth grade (and the glory of recognition at an assembly). Boys also performed better, apparently because they were pushed by the girls or didn&rsquo;t want to endure the embarrassment of being left behind.</p>
<p>Another Kenyan study found that giving girls a new $6 school uniform every 18 months significantly reduced dropout rates and pregnancy rates. Likewise, there&rsquo;s growing evidence that a cheap way to help keep high-school girls in school is to help them manage menstruation. For fear of embarrassing leaks and stains, girls sometimes stay home during their periods, and the absenteeism puts them behind and eventually leads them to drop out. Aid workers are experimenting with giving African teenage girls sanitary pads, along with access to a toilet where they can change them. The Campaign for Female Education, an organization devoted to getting more girls into school in Africa, helps girls with their periods, and a new group, Sustainable Health Enterprises, is trying to do the same.</p>
<p>And so, if President Obama wanted to adopt a foreign-aid policy that built on insights into the role of women in development, he would do well to start with education. We would suggest a $10 billion effort over five years to educate girls around the world. This initiative would focus on Africa but would also support &mdash; and prod &mdash; Asian countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan to do better. This plan would also double as population policy, for it would significantly reduce birthrates &mdash; and thus help poor countries overcome the demographic obstacles to economic growth.</p>
<p>But President Obama might consider two different proposals as well. We would recommend that the United States sponsor a global drive to eliminate iodine deficiency around the globe, by helping countries iodize salt. About a third of households in the developing world do not get enough iodine, and a result is often an impairment in brain formation in the fetal stages. For reasons that are unclear, this particularly affects female fetuses and typically costs children 10 to 15 I.Q. points. Research by Erica Field of Harvard found that daughters of women given iodine performed markedly better in school. Other research suggests that salt iodization would yield benefits worth nine times the cost.</p>
<p>We would also recommend that the United States announce a 12-year, $1.6 billion program to eradicate obstetric fistula, a childbirth injury that is one of the worst scourges of women in the developing world. An obstetric fistula, which is a hole created inside the body by a difficult childbirth, leaves a woman incontinent, smelly, often crippled and shunned by her village &mdash; yet it can be repaired for a few hundred dollars. Dr. Lewis Wall, president of the Worldwide Fistula Fund, and Michael Horowitz, a conservative agitator on humanitarian issues, have drafted the 12-year plan &mdash; and it&rsquo;s eminently practical and built on proven methods. Evidence that fistulas can be prevented or repaired comes from impoverished Somaliland, a northern enclave of Somalia, where an extraordinary nurse-midwife named Edna Adan has built her own maternity hospital to save the lives of the women around her. A former first lady of Somalia and World Health Organization official, Adan used her savings to build the hospital, which is supported by a group of admirers in the U.S. who call themselves Friends of Edna Maternity Hospital.</p>
<p>For all the legitimate concerns about how well humanitarian aid is spent, investments in education, iodizing salt and maternal health all have a proven record of success. And the sums are modest: all three components of our plan together amount to about what the U.S. has provided Pakistan since 9/11 &mdash; a sum that accomplished virtually nothing worthwhile either for Pakistanis or for Americans.</p>
<p>ONE OF THE MANY aid groups that for pragmatic reasons has increasingly focused on women is Heifer International, a charitable organization based in Arkansas that has been around for decades. The organization gives cows, goats and chickens to farmers in poor countries. On assuming the presidency of Heifer in 1992, the activist Jo Luck traveled to Africa, where one day she found herself sitting on the ground with a group of young women in a Zimbabwean village. One of them was Tererai Trent.</p>
<p>Tererai is a long-faced woman with high cheekbones and a medium brown complexion; she has a high forehead and tight cornrows. Like many women around the world, she doesn&rsquo;t know when she was born and has no documentation of her birth. As a child, Tererai didn&rsquo;t get much formal education, partly because she was a girl and was expected to do household chores. She herded cattle and looked after her younger siblings. Her father would say, Let&rsquo;s send our sons to school, because they will be the breadwinners. Tererai&rsquo;s brother, Tinashe, was forced to go to school, where he was an indifferent student. Tererai pleaded to be allowed to attend but wasn&rsquo;t permitted to do so. Tinashe brought his books home each afternoon, and Tererai pored over them and taught herself to read and write. Soon she was doing her brother&rsquo;s homework every evening.</p>
<p>The teacher grew puzzled, for Tinashe was a poor student in class but always handed in exemplary homework. Finally, the teacher noticed that the handwriting was different for homework and for class assignments and whipped Tinashe until he confessed the truth. Then the teacher went to the father, told him that Tererai was a prodigy and begged that she be allowed to attend school. After much argument, the father allowed Tererai to attend school for a couple of terms, but then married her off at about age 11.</p>
<p>Tererai&rsquo;s husband barred her from attending school, resented her literacy and beat her whenever she tried to practice her reading by looking at a scrap of old newspaper. Indeed, he beat her for plenty more as well. She hated her marriage but had no way out. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a woman and you are not educated, what else?&rdquo; she asks.</p>
<p>Yet when Jo Luck came and talked to Tererai and other young women in her village, Luck kept insisting that things did not have to be this way. She kept saying that they could achieve their goals, repeatedly using the word &ldquo;achievable.&rdquo; The women caught the repetition and asked the interpreter to explain in detail what &ldquo;achievable&rdquo; meant. That gave Luck a chance to push forward. &ldquo;What are your hopes?&rdquo; she asked the women, through the interpreter. Tererai and the others were puzzled by the question, because they didn&rsquo;t really have any hopes. But Luck pushed them to think about their dreams, and reluctantly, they began to think about what they wanted.</p>
<p>Tererai timidly voiced hope of getting an education. Luck pounced and told her that she could do it, that she should write down her goals and methodically pursue them. After Luck and her entourage disappeared, Tererai began to study on her own, in hiding from her husband, while raising her five children. Painstakingly, with the help of friends, she wrote down her goals on a piece of paper: &ldquo;One day I will go to the United States of America,&rdquo; she began, for Goal 1. She added that she would earn a college degree, a master&rsquo;s degree and a Ph.D. &mdash; all exquisitely absurd dreams for a married cattle herder in Zimbabwe who had less than one year&rsquo;s formal education. But Tererai took the piece of paper and folded it inside three layers of plastic to protect it, and then placed it in an old can. She buried the can under a rock where she herded cattle.</p>
<p>Then Tererai took correspondence classes and began saving money. Her self-confidence grew as she did brilliantly in her studies, and she became a community organizer for Heifer. She stunned everyone with superb schoolwork, and the Heifer aid workers encouraged her to think that she could study in America. One day in 1998, she received notice that she had been admitted to Oklahoma State University.</p>
<p>Some of the neighbors thought that a woman should focus on educating her children, not herself. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk about my children&rsquo;s education when I&rsquo;m not educated myself,&rdquo; Tererai responded. &ldquo;If I educate myself, then I can educate my children.&rdquo; So she climbed into an airplane and flew to America.</p>
<p>At Oklahoma State, Tererai took every credit she could and worked nights to make money. She earned her undergraduate degree, brought her five children to America and started her master&rsquo;s, then returned to her village. She dug up the tin can under the rock and took out the paper on which she had scribbled her goals. She put check marks beside the goals she had fulfilled and buried the tin can again.</p>
<p>In Arkansas, she took a job working for Heifer &mdash; while simultaneously earning a master&rsquo;s degree part time. When she had her M.A., Tererai again returned to her village. After embracing her mother and sister, she dug up her tin can and checked off her next goal. Now she is working on her Ph.D. at Western Michigan University.</p>
<p>Tererai has completed her course work and is completing a dissertation about AIDS programs among the poor in Africa. She will become a productive economic asset for Africa and a significant figure in the battle against AIDS. And when she has her doctorate, Tererai will go back to her village and, after hugging her loved ones, go out to the field and dig up her can again.</p>
<p>There are many metaphors for the role of foreign assistance. For our part, we like to think of aid as a kind of lubricant, a few drops of oil in the crankcase of the developing world, so that gears move freely again on their own. That is what the assistance to Tererai amounted to: a bit of help where and when it counts most, which often means focusing on women like her. And now Tererai is gliding along freely on her own &mdash; truly able to hold up half the sky.</p>

<p>&uml;THIS SUMMER DO YOU WANT TO BE A MERMAID OR A WHALE?&uml;</p>
<p>A middle aged woman, whose physical characteristics did not match those of<br />
  the woman on the poster, responded publicly to the question posed by the<br />
  gym.</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>Whales are always surrounded by friends (dolphins, sea lions, curious<br />
  humans). They have an active sex life, they get pregnant and have adorable<br />
  baby whales. They have a wonderful time with dolphins stuffing themselves<br />
  with shrimp. They play and swim in the seas, seeing wonderful places like<br />
  Patagonia, the Barren Sea and the coral reefs of Polynesia . Whales are<br />
  wonderful singers and have even recorded CDs. They are incredible<br />
  creatures and virtually have no predators other than humans. They are<br />
  loved, protected and admired by almost everyone in the world.</p>
<p>Mermaids don&sbquo;t exist. If they did exist, they would be lining up outside<br />
  the offices of Argentinean psychoanalysts due to identity crisis. Fish or<br />
  human? They don&sbquo;t have a sex life because they kill men who get close to<br />
  them not to mention how could they have sex? Therefore they do not have<br />
  kids either. Not to mention who wants to get close to a girl who smells<br />
  like a fish store? The choice is perfectly clear to me; I want to be a whale.</p>
<p>P.S. We are in an age when media puts into our heads the idea that only<br />
  skinny people are beautiful, but I prefer to enjoy an ice cream with my<br />
  kids, a good dinner with a man who makes me shiver and lunch with my<br />
  friends. With time we gain weight because we accumulate so much<br />
  information and wisdom in our heads that when there is no more room it<br />
  distributes out to the rest of our bodies. So we aren't heavy, we are<br />
  enormously cultured, educated and happy. Beginning today, when I look at<br />
  my butt in the mirror I will think, Good gosh, look how smart I am.</p>

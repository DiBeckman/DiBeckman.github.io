  to Some Basic Ideas about Intercultural Communication</b><br>
  by Dean Hipple, Elena Choquet, Grant Douglas<br>
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> There 
  are many definitions of culture. One way of summarizing them is:<br>
  <br>
  CULTURE is the sum total of ways of living; including values, beliefs, language, 
  aesthetic standards (what is considered beautiful), patterns of thinking, behavioural 
  norms, and styles of communication, which a group of people have developed to 
  assure its survival in a particular physical and human environment. Culture, 
  and the people who are part of it, interact, so that culture is not static.<br>
  <br>
  CULTURE incorporates or shapes virtually all aspects of human life, including:<br>
  &#149; THE WAY OF LIFE for a particular group of people<br>
  &#149; THE ARTS: arts, music, dance, theatre, literature, architecture<br>
  &#149; HISTORY/HERITAGE: the roots and longevity of a people or society<br>
  &#149; BEHAVIOR: how people act and interact in various situations<br>
  &#149; VALUES AND BELIEFS about the way the world is ordered<br>
  &#149; CUSTOMS: ceremonies, rituals, traditions, morals, manners<br>
  &#149; SENSORY DATA: everything seen, heard, felt, touched, or tasted<br>
  &#149; LANGUAGE: thinking processes &amp; philosophies; communication styles-verbal 
  and non-verbal<br>
  &#149; A WAY TO ORGANIZE THE WORLD and to make sense of our environment<br>
  &#149; A LEARNED SYSTEM OF FUNCTIONING, which we are born into but which we 
  FORGET WE HAVE LEARNED.<br>
  &#149; A SOCIAL SYSTEM: government, education, religion, laws, etc.</font></p>

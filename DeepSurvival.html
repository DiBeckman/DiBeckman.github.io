  <br />
What survivors do:</p>
<p>1)<span class="style1"> Perceive, believe</span> (<span class="style2">look, see, believe</span>)<br />
  Even in the intial crisis, survivor's perceptions and cognitive functions keep working. They notice details and may even find some humorous or beautiful. If there is any denial, it is counterbalanced by a solid belief in the clear evidence of their senses. They immediately begin to recognize, acknowledge, and even accept the reality of their situation. . .They may initially blame forces outside themselves, too; but very quickly dismiss that tactic and recognize that everything good and bad, emanates from within. They see opportunity, even good, in their situation. They move through denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance very rapidly. </p>
<p>2) <span class="style1">Stay calm</span> (<span class="style2">use humor, fear to focus</span>)<br />
In the intitial crisis, survivors are making use of fear, not being ruled by it. Their fear often feels like and turns into anger, and that motivates them and makes them sharper. They understand at a deep level about being cool and are ever on their guard against the mutiny of too much emotions. They keep their sense of humor and therefore calm. </p>
<p>3) <span class="style2"><strong>Think/ analyze/ plan</strong></span> (<span class="style2">get organized; set up small, manageable tasks</span>). <br />
  Survivors quickly organize, set up routines, and institute discipline. In successful group survival situations, a leader emerges often from the least likely candidate. They push away thoughts that their situation is hopeless. A rational voice emerges and is often actually heard, which takes control of the situation. Survivors perceive that experience as being split into two people and they &quot;obey&quot; the rational one. It begins with the paradox of seeing reality&mdash;how hopeless it would seem to an outside observer&mdash;but acting with the expectation of success.</p>
<p>4) <span class="style2"><strong>Take correct, decisive action</strong></span> (<span class="style2">be bold and cautious while carrying out tasks</span>)<br />
  Survivors are able to transform thought into action. They are willing to take risks to save themselves and others. They are able to break down large jobs into small, manageable tasks. They set attainable goals and develop short-term plans to reach them. They are meticulous about doing those tasks well. They deal with what is within their power from moment to moment, hour to hour, day to day. They leave the rest behind.</p>
<p>5) <span class="style2"><strong>Celebrate your successes</strong></span> (<span class="style2">take joy in completing tasks</span>)<br />
Survivors take great joy from even their smallest successes. That is an important step in creating an ongoing feeling of motivation and preventing the descent into hopelessness. It also provides relief from the unspeakable stress of a true survival situation.</p>
<p>6) <span class="style1">Count your blessings</span> (<span class="style2">be grateful&mdash;you're alive</span>)<br />
This is how survivors become rescuers instead of victims. There is always someone else they are helping more than themselves, even if that someone is not present. One suvivor I spoke to, Yossi Ghinsberg, who was lost for weeks in the Bolivian jungle, hallucinated about a beautiful companion with whom he slept every night as he traveled. Everything he did, he did for her.</p>
<p>7) <span class="style2"><strong>Play</strong></span> (<span class="style2">sing, play mind games, recite poetry, count anything, do mathematical problems in your head</span>)<br />
  Since the brain and its wiring appear to be the determining factor in survival, this is an argument for expanding and refining it. The more you have learned and experienced of art, music, poetry, literature, philosophy, matematics, and so on, the more resources you will have to fall back on. Just as survivors use patterns and rhythm to move forward in the survival voyage, they use the deeper activities of the intellect to stimulate, calm and entertain the mind. Counting becomes important, too, and reciting poetry or a mantra can calm the frantic mind. Movement becomes dance. One survivor who had to walk a long way counted his steps, one hundred at a time, and dedicated each hundred to another person he cared about.</p>
<p>Stockdale cites &quot;love of poetry&quot; as a important quality for enduring. &quot;You thirst to remember. The clutter of all the trivia evaporates from your consciousness and with care you can make deep excursions into past recollections. . .Verses were hoarded and gone over each day. . . [T]he person who came into the experiment with reams of already memorized poetry was the bearer of great gifts.&quot;<br />
  <br />
Surviors often cling to talismans. They search for meaning, and more you know already, the deeper the meaning. They engage the crisis almost as a game. They discover the flow of the expert performer, in whom emotion and thought balance each other in producing action. &quot;Careful, careful,&quot; they say. But they act joyfully and decisively. Playing also leads to invention, and invention may lead to a new technique strategy, or a piece of equipment that could save you.</p>
<p>8) <span class="style1">See the beauty</span> (<span class="style2">remember: it's a vision quest</span>)<br />
Survivors are attuned to the wonder of the world. The appreciation of beauty, the feeling of awe, opens the senses. When you see something beautiful, your pupils actually dilate. This appreciation not only relieves stress and creates strong motivation, but it allows you to iake in new information more effectively.</p>
<p>9) <span class="style2"><strong>Believe that you will succeed</strong></span> (<span class="style2">develop a deep conviction that you'll live</span>)<br />
  All of the practices just described lead to this point: survivors consolidate their personalities and fix their determination. Survivors admonish themselves to make no more mistakes, to be very careful, and to do their very best. They become convinced that they will prevail if they do those things.</p>
<p>10) <span class="style2"><strong>Surrender</strong></span> (<span class="style2">let go of your fear of dying: &quot;put away the pain&quot;</span>)<br />
Suvivors manage pain well. Lauren Elder, (chapter 13), who walked out of the Sierra Nevada after surviving a plane crash, wrote that she &quot;stored away the information: my arm is broken.&quot; That sort of thinking is what John Leach calls &quot;resignation without giving up. It is survival by surrender.&quot; Joe Simpson recognized that he would probably die. But it ceased to bother him, and so he went ahead and crawled off the mountain anyway.</p>
<p>11) <span class="style1">Do whatever is necessary</span> (<span class="style2">be determined; have the will and the skill</span>)<br />
Survivors have met-knowledge: they know their abilities and do not over- or underestimate them. They believe that anything is possible and act accordingly. Play leads to invention, which leads to trying something that might have seemed impossible. . .Survivors don't expect or even hope to be rescued. They are coldly rational about using the world, obtaining what they need, doing what they have to do.</p>
<p>12) <span class="style1">Never give up</span> (<span class="style2">let nothing break your spirit</span>)<br />
  There is always one more thing you can do. Survivors are not easily frustrated. They are not discouraged by setbacks. They accept that the environment (or the business climate or their health) is constantly changing. They pick themselves up and start the entire process all over again, breaking it down into manageable bits. Survivors always have a clear reason for going on. Theykeep their spirits up by developing an alternate world made up of rich meories to which they can escape. They mine their memory for whatever will keep them occupied. They come to embrace the world in which they find themselves and see opportunity in adversity. In the aftermath, survivors learn from and are grateful for the experiences they've had.

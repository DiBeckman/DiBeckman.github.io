<p class="style1">If Rousseau is Romanticism&rsquo;s precursor, Wordsworth is its herald. He and Samuel Coleridge literally wrote the book on what romantic poetry should be in the preface to their collaborative collection of <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>, second edition, published in 1800. In contrast with the poetry of the Enlightenment, such as the poems of Pope, because of their artificial language and aristocratic subject matter, Wordsworth wants to use real language without giving up meter, rhyme and poetic figures. Worsworth provided the most famous definition of poetry from this period which I include on my <a href="222Enlitenmentcf.html">Enlightenment and Romanticism chart</a>: <span class="style3"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#147;spontaneous overflow of powerful feeling; it takes its origin from 
emotion recalled in tranquility.&#148;</font></span> </p>
<p class="style1">Question for the class: which words in this definition connect with romanticism? Answer: spontaneous, overflow, powerful, feeling, emotion, recall, tranquillity. Nearly all of them!! </p>
<p class="style1">In the past poetry dealt with actions and situation or philosophy, but Wordsworth suggests through the imagination we can recapture <span class="style4">feelings</span> brought to us by a certain <span class="style4">experience</span>. The poet must reshape the world of <span class="style4">common perception</span> to make it more pleasurable and meaningful. The subject of poetry is to be, as one critic put it &ldquo;The Marriage of the Mind of Man and the Goodly Universe of Nature.&quot; Finally the romantic view is made clear here: it is a different kind of optimism than we saw with Pangloss. The romantics  desire to transcend the limitations of time and pace. </p>
<p class="style1">This poem, Ode on  Inimtations of Immortality, p. 699 treats the problems of TIME, MEMORY, INSIGHT, and CONSOLATION.  We go back and forth between the real and the ideal&mdash;the basic framework is one of <strong>questions</strong> and <strong>answers</strong>. Questions are raised at the end of Stanza 4  and then given two different answers:<br />
  first a rather <em>despairing </em>one in Stanzas 5-8, and then a <em>hopeful </em>one in the last three stanza. <br />
  <br />
  As always, let's look at the title. First, what is an ode? <br />
  <br />
  <font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#FF0000"><b>Ode</b></font><br />
  An ode is a long, lyric poem, serious in subject, elevated in style and elaborate 
  in its stanzaic structure&#133; The irregular ode allows each stanza to establish 
  its own pattern of varying line lengths, number of lines and rhyme scheme. This 
  type has been the most common for the English Ode; Wordsworth&#146;s great &#147;Ode: 
  Intimations of Immortality&#148; is representative&#133; Romantic poets preferred 
  the personal ode of description and passionate meditation, which is stimulated 
  by an aspect of the outer scene and turns on the attempt to solve either a private 
  problem or a generally human one.<br />
Abrams, <i>A Glossary of Literary Terms</i>.</font></p>
<p class="style1">We can see that Wordsworth's poem is so famous that it is used in the definition of the term &quot;ode&quot;! Next, <span class="style4">Intimations </span>is the difficult word, meaning hints or suggestions, akin to the word <em>intimate</em>. <span class="style4"><span class="style5">Wordsworth is not going to preach at us, like Pope. He is going to hint.</span> Immortality</span> is a wonderful romantic word: eternal life, beyond our earthly limits. </p>
<p class="style1">Next we have the Epigraph (like Pushkin, Wordsworth uses lines from another of his poems): </p>
<p class="style1">The Child is Father of the Man<br />
And I could wish my days to be<br />
Bound each to each in natural piety.<br />
<br />
What does this mean? First that wisdom is located in childhood. We can learn from our children. We see how they are connected to nature. There is a continuity between what we <em>were</em> and what we <em>are</em>. What happens to us in childhood affects and even determines what will we become, as we saw in Rousseau. The last two lines suggest an attitude of piety and respect for nature and suggests that man and his cycles are part of nature. This is an important part of Romantic ideology. </p>
<p class="style1">(We noticed that Pope capitalized abstract nouns. Here Concrete nouns are capitalized. We're still moving towards modern English practice.) </p>
<p class="style1">First stanza: The essential contrast is between <strong>past </strong>and<strong> present</strong>. Which words connect with each? The  past is clearly lit; what kind of light? Glory&mdash;word repeated many times in the poem. End of next stanza&mdash;day and night opposed; Glory and light, sunshine are in the past, as at birth. </p>
<p class="style1">What is glory? adoring praise, honor, resplendent beauty, a surrounding radiance of light (halo)</p>
<p class="style1">Stanza 2: What do Rainbow, Rose, Moon, Waters, Sunshine all have in common? They are all natural and they all change. Their beauty comes and goes. Wordworth is grieving a change and a loss. Glory is gone. </p>
<p class="style1">Stanza 3: Change in mood: from joy-&gt;grief-&gt;relief: what does he mean by timely utterance? Mostly likely a poem. Images are about sounds: birds, tabor (drum), trumpets, waterfalls, echoes, winds, shouts! World is full of sound.</p>
<p class="style1">Stanza 4: Relief doesn&rsquo;t bring joy. Senses are all disconnected&mdash;disconnected from Nature; he looks at the tree, the field, and the pansy and feels alone. 2 different questions&mdash;where did the light go? Where is it now? It may be gone but still retrievable. Can we get it back?</p>
<p class="style1">Stanza 5 take us into a more abstract realm back to Plato&rsquo;s Allegory of the Cave. We used to be able to see the glory, but now when we are born, we actually begin to forget. To oversimplify the idea here, before birth the soul dwells in heaven in a world of total light and harmony. What Wordsworth calls here God/home/heaven. But when the soul has to descend and enter a human soul, &ldquo;trailing clouds of glory,&rdquo; (there&rsquo;s that word glory again) it begins a period of exile. Yet the soul is haunted (like Hermann the German?)  with memory of the perfect light, and keeps trying to find it. As we age, from Infant, Growing Boy, Youth, and Man we go further from that light, from our natural connection with God. Image of prison, trapped man&mdash;inmate. Strangely enough, the Earth is not the same as Nature here&mdash;it&rsquo;s the Earth that distracts us, takes us away from the light in Stanza 6. </p>
<p class="style1">Stanzas 7-8 Who is the Best Philosopher here? The child. We see the child growing up and playing different roles. Wordsworth connects getting older with negative images: blindly, yoke, freight, weight, strife. </p>
<p class="style1">If the poem ended here, it would be very sad. But the last three stanzas offer us another answer. We know we&rsquo;ve lost the glory but it isn&rsquo;t irretrievably gone. In Stanza 9 we learn that it is not just happy memories of a better time, that bare deserving of praise. Instead it is our ability to question obstinately. The shadowy recollections lead us back to the Absolute; Sight and Sound come back together. What words suggest the light of heaven's glory? fountain-light, master-light, cherish, joy. We are transported to sea shore. How is the sea the perfect image for immortality and eternity where children play? Which words connect with <em>Immortality</em> from the title? eternal, perish never, immortal, evermore. . . </p>
<p class="style1">Stanza X picks up the sounds of III: <br />
  We accept that we can&rsquo;t go back again, completely. Just as Candide had to find a new garden, here Wordsworth says that out of suffering Imaginative Man/ the Philosophic man has soothing thoughts that become his consolation. Ignorance/ innocence may be bliss, but the poignancy of knowing, the beauty of the sunset, awareness of mortality and loss give rise to feelings more  precious than tears. I always ask in class looking at lines 199-203 whether the sunrise (the child) or the sunset (the adult) is more beautiful. The answer, of course, is that they are both beautiful. The final lines of the poem talk about human feeling that is <strong>Too deep for tears</strong>, inexpressible. It is better to have lived and lost the glory, as long as we can experience  feelings, our human heart. Ironically, it is our mortality that gives us the gifts of appreciating immortality. Children don't appreciate the fragility of life, but adults do. </p>
<p class="style1">There are similar themes in our second poem, the most famous romantic poem in France, Lamaratine's <em>Le Lac</em> (p. 772). Once again we connect autobiography, nature, and poetry; as in Wordsworth&rsquo;s <em>Ode</em>, the theme is the passage of time, desire for infinity: here with a focus on romantic love.</p>
<p class="style1">Like Wordsworth, Lamartine considered himself an innovator&mdash;bringing poetry down from the Parnassus, the mountain of the Greek Muses He said, &quot;Instead of playing the traditional 7 stringed lyre, I play the very fibers of the human heart, touched by the many vibrations of the soul and of nature.&rdquo; Like Candide, Lamartine's poems were best sellers in their time. Just looking at the form, however, it&rsquo;s also possible to see the neoclassical elements in Lamartine&rsquo;s poem&mdash;his aristocratic heritage. One of literature&rsquo;s best examples of the &ldquo;pathetic fallacy&rdquo; attributing human feelings to nature or inanimate objects: </p>
<p class="style1">Poster: <font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#FF0000"><b>Pathetic Fallacy</b></font>: &quot;A phrase originated 
  by Ruskin in <i>Modern Painters</i>, Vol. III, Part IV (1856) to describe the 
  attribution of human characteristics to inanimate objects. Such an attribution 
  usually falls short of a full personification. Quoting a phrase from Kinglsey, 
  &quot;the cruel, crawling foam,&quot; Ruskin said, &quot;The foam is not cruel, 
  not does it crawl&#133;All violent feelings&#133;produce in use a falseness 
  in all our impressions of external things, which I would characterize as the 
  'Pathetic Fallacy'. &quot;<br />
  <br />
Ruskin qualified his condemnation by admitting that examples of the pathetic 
  fallacy, though false to nature, were often were beautiful. This phenomenon, 
  he argued, was usually found in poets whom he placed in the second rank (such 
  as Wordsworth, Coleridge, Tennyson) whose who felt strongly but thought weakly. 
  Great poets, who both felt and thought strongly, would not so distort nature 
  unless, under the stress of prophetic inspiration, they were attempting to express 
  something so incomparably above them that no human mind could perceive it truly. 
  Though this distinction in the use of the pathetic fallacy has been criticized 
  as dubiously subjective, Ruskin's term has remained useful. Today, however, 
  it is descriptive and carries no pejorative connotations.&quot; <br />
Beckson and Ganz, <i>Literary Terms, A Dictionary</i> </font></p>
<p class="style1">There is an important backstory. Lamartine falls in love with a married woman whom he met at a sanatorium (to recover from tuberculosis). They plan to meet again a year later, but Lamartine finds himself alone on the shore&mdash;his lover is dying in Paris and she cannot not come to be with him. <br />
  <br />
  Le Lac de B****= how writers would disguise names of real places or people.</p>
<p class="style1">There is a real <a href="222Lelac.htm">lake</a>, a real night, but since this is poetry we&rsquo;re working on two levels at once, what does the lake stand for?  &ldquo;time&rsquo;s vast ocean.&rdquo; What is the meaning of the metaphor of the anchor? (Stopping time.) Who is &ldquo;we&rdquo;? Relentless flow of time; wanting to stop it at a happy moment.</p>
<p class="style1">&quot;Oh Lake, Oh Time&quot;&mdash;shows us the classical heritage of the <a href="222Autobiography.html">elegy</a>&mdash;dramatic diction. Lamartine <strong>personifies</strong> the lake and addresses it directly four times in the next two verses. The lake is much more alive &amp; energetic than Julie&mdash;it roars, it crashes, and it&rsquo;s also more constant than she is--three times in as many lines poet says ainsi (then as now) For the moment, Julie only appears as foam-covered feet. </p>
<p class="style1">What&rsquo;s more romantic, harmonious, heavenly  than the atmosphere, boat drifting at night, the only sounds are the musical lapping of the waves, splash of the oars&mdash;then we hear an angelic voice from on high&mdash;who is speaking now?</p>
<p class="style1">Why it's Julie&mdash;from the past. She&rsquo;s doing the same thing the narrator did in the second stanza&mdash;addressing time as thought it were a person! Several elements straight from traditional love poetry&mdash;carpe diem theme; dawn coming to separate the lovers (ironic version of that in <em>Queen of Spades</em> the  old woman dies and Herman has to sneak out of the house). We return imagery of the first verse: there is no port, resting spot for us, time is endlessly rolling out before us.</p>
<p class="style1">Romantic theme par excellence&mdash;subject of verses 10 and 11&mdash;moments of intoxication. Lamartine tries to enlist Nature in his struggle against Time. What is more fragile, more ephemeral than our lives, our love? We see the emotional intensity of narrator increase--Verse 11, change in rhythm more marked in French- H&eacute; quoi? Hey, what?! Real contrast with the formal language- O Lake, O time.</p>
<p class="style1">The imagery gets more creepy. swallowed into nothingness--Whirlpools, black holes. Into the silence the poet cries with repeated exclamations&mdash;putting everything on pause, wanting to stop time forever. </p>
<p class="style1">Motifs of <strong>light</strong> and <strong>sound </strong>echo what we saw in the poem by Wordsworth. The wind and the reeds take the poet&rsquo;s voice&mdash;sighing and moaning, repetition of the <strong>prayer</strong>&mdash;in French it says: let the wind, the reeds, the perfumed breezes say &rdquo;They loved.&rdquo; Much stronger than the final line of the English. <strong>Nature itself becomes a lyric poem</strong>.<br />
  <br />
In both poems, a key theme is the immortality of nature. Wordsworth goes after nature's immortal qualities, while Lamartine asks nature to forever preserve his memories of his love affair. Wordsworth speaks of our existence after death, &quot;&quot;O joy! that in our embers/ Is something that doth live./ That nature yet remembers/ What was so fugitive! (W 134-7), saying that we live on in nature after we die, and are able to more truly perceive nature with the veil of life out of the way. Lamartine does the opposite, trying to hold on to life and begging nature to save his memories and experiences. Both agree nature is eternal and powerful, but both have different reactions and behavior toward nature.</p>
<p class="style1">To end, here is one of my favorite student comments on <em>The Lake</em>:</p>
<p class="style7">Lamartine asks NATURE to do what he and Julie could not, that is, to continue their LOVE beyond the exigencies of TIME. </p>

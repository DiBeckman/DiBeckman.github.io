<p class="style15">&#147;Joyce is the 
  most self-centered of universal minds. Far more than explicitly than most writers 
&#133; he exploited his personal experience for purposes of literary documentation. 
  His youth in Dublin, subject to the limitations of poor eyesight, the perceptions 
  of acute hearing, the exaggerations of immaturity, the natural bonds of emotion 
  and unnatural tensions of resistance, furnished his only subject-matter. He forgot 
  nothing and forgave nothing. Any resemblance to actual persons and situations, 
  living or dead, was carefully cultivated.&#148;<br>

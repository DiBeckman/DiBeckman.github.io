<p>Title: Artist: INDIA.ARIE Song: I AM NOT MY HAIR Album: TESTIMONY: VOL. 1, LIFE &amp; RELATIONSHIP (2006) </p>
<p>(Spoken) <br />
  Is that India? What happened to her hair? </p>
<p>Da da da da da </p>
<p>(Verse 1) <br />
  Little girl with the press and curls <br />
  Age 8 I got a jerry curl <br />
  13 and I got a relaxer <br />
  I was the source of so much laughter <br />
  15 when it all broke off <br />
  18 when I went all natural <br />
  February 2002 <br />
  I went on and did what I had to do </p>
<p>Cuz it was time to change my life <br />
  To become the woman that I am inside <br />
  97 dread locs all grown <br />
  I looked in the mirror for the first time and saw that (hey) </p>
<p>(Chorus) <br />
  I am not my hair <br />
  I am not this skin <br />
  I am not your expectations (no) <br />
  I am not my hair <br />
  I am not this skin <br />
  I am the soul that lives within </p>
<p>(Spoken) <br />
  What she do to her? <br />
  I don&rsquo;t know; it look crazy! <br />
  I like it. <br />
  I might do that. <br />
  I wouldn&rsquo;t go that far. </p>
<p>(Verse 2) <br />
  Good hair means curls and waves. <br />
  Bad hair means you look like a slave <br />
  At the turn of the century <br />
  Its time for us to redefine who we be <br />
  You can shave it off like an African beauty <br />
  Got in on &ldquo;loc&rdquo; like Bob Marley <br />
  You can rock it straight like Oprah Winfrey <br />
  It&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s on your head, it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s underneath (say hey) </p>
<p>(Chorus) <br />
  I am not my hair <br />
  I am not this skin <br />
  I am not your expectations (no) <br />
  I am not my hair <br />
  I am not this skin <br />
  I am the soul that lives within </p>
<p>Does the way I wear my hair make me a better person <br />
  Does the way I wear my hair make me a better friend <br />
  Does the way I wear my hair determine my integrity <br />
  Expressing my creativity </p>
<p>(Verse 3) <br />
  Breast cancer and chemotherapy <br />
  Took away her crown and glory <br />
  She promised God if she was to survive <br />
  She would enjoy everyday of her life <br />
  On national television her diamond eyes are sparkling <br />
  Baldheaded like a full moon shining <br />
  Singing out to the whole wide world like hey </p>
<p>(Chorus) <br />
  I am not my hair <br />
  I am not this skin <br />
  I am not your expectations (no) <br />
  I am not my hair <br />
  I am not this skin <br />
  I am the soul that lives within <br />
  (Repeat) </p>
<p>If I wanna shave it close or I wanna rock locs <br />
  That don&rsquo;t take a bit away from this soul that I got </p>
<p>If I wanna wear it braided all down my back <br />
  I don&rsquo;t see nothing wrong with that </p>

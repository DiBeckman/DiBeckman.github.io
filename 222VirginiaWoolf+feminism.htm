 <p class="style4">Virginia Woolf and Feminism: a cartoon and a few quotes to consider<br>
 </p>
 <p class="style4"><img src="RozChast2.jpg" width="516" height="477"></p>
 <p class="style1">&bull; Rousseau in his treatise on education, <em>Emile,</em> 1762 :</p>
 <p class="style1">&ldquo;For this reason the education of women should always be relative to men. To please, to be useful to us, to make us love and esteem them, to educate us when young, and to take care of us when grown up, to advise us, to console us, to render our lives easy and agreeable&mdash;these are the duties of women at all times, and what they should be taught in their infancy.&rdquo;</p>
 <p class="style1">&bull; Mary Wollencraft in <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Women</em>, 1792:</p>
 <p class="style1">&quot;How many women thus waste life away the prey of discontent, who might have practised as physicians, regulated a farm, managed a shop, and stood erect, supported by their own industry, instead of hanging their heads surrounded with the dew of sensibility, that consumes the beauty to which it first gave lustre&hellip;</p>
 <p class="style1">Would men but generously snap our chains, and be content with rational friendship instead of slavish obedience, they would find us more observant daughters, more affectionate sisters, more reasonable mothers&mdash;in a word, better citizens. We should then love them with true affection, because we should learn to respect ourselves; and the peace of mind of a worthy man would not be interrupted by the dull vanity of his wife, nor the babes sent to nestle in a strange bosom, having never found a home in their mother&rsquo;s.&quot;</p>
 <p class="style1">&bull; John Stuart Mill from <em>The Subjection of Women</em>, 1861:</p>
 <p class="style1">&quot;That the principle which regulates the existing social relations between the two sexes&mdash;the legal subordination of one sex to the other&mdash;is wrong in itself, and now one of the chief hindrances to human improvement; and that it ought to be replaced by a principle of perfect equality, admitting no power or privilege on the one side, nor disability on the other&hellip;When we put together three things&mdash;first the natural attraction between opposite sexes; secondly, the wife&rsquo;s entire dependence on the husband, every privilege or pleasure she has being either his gift, or depending entirely on his will; and lastly, that the principal object of human pursuit, consideration, and all objects of social ambition, can in general be sought or obtained by her only through him, it would be a miracle if the object of being attractive to men had not become the polar star of feminine education and formation of character.&quot; </p>
 <p class="style3">Arthur Rimbaud from <em>Letter to a Seer</em>, 1871: <br>
     <br>
   And there will be poets like this! When the eternal slavery of Women is destroyed, when she lives for herself and through herself, when man&mdash;up till now abominable&mdash;will have set her free, she will be a poet as well! Woman will discover the unknown! Will her world of ideas differ from ours? She will discover strange things, unfathomable, repulsive, delightful; we will accept and understand them.</p>
 <p class="style3">While we wait, let us ask the <em>poet</em> for <em>something new</em>&mdash;ideas and forms. </p>
 <p class="style3">Gloria Steinem, <a href="imcm_orig.pdf">If Men Could Menstruate</a>, Ms Magazine, October 1978</p>

<p class="style2">Some quotes from Chekhov:</p>
<p class="style1">&ldquo;I can only write from memory, not direct from nature. The subject of my story must first pass through the filter of my mind, so that only the typical and significant remains.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style1">&ldquo;You should sit down to write only when you feel as cold as ice.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="style1">&ldquo;Throw your personality overboard, don&rsquo;t make yourself the hero of your story, renounce yourself for at least half an hour&hellip; Your play will be no good if all characters are like you&hellip; Give people people, not yourself&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="style1">&ldquo;I have believed in progress&hellip;for the difference between the time I used to be beaten (by my father) and the time when I ceased to be beaten, was tremendous. Reason and justice tell me that in electricity and steam there is more love for mankind than in chastity and abstinence from meat.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="style1">&ldquo;Medicine is my lawful wife, literature my mistress.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="style1">&ldquo;Odd, I have now a mania for shortness. Whatever I read&mdash;my own work, or other people&rsquo;s &mdash;it all seems to me not short enough.&rdquo; In his notebook he copied a page from Daudet &mdash;&ldquo;Why, a bird was asked,&rdquo; are your songs so short? Are you short of breath?&rdquo; And the bird answered: I have very many songs, and I should like to sing them all.&rdquo;] When asked what he would do if he were rich, Chekhov replied: &ldquo;Write the tiniest possible stories. Were I a millionaire I would produce works no longer than the palm of my hand.&rdquo; He advised another writer to cut out the beginning and end of his story: &ldquo;It is there that we authors do most of our lying.&rdquo; &ldquo;A single detail suffices&rdquo; provided it is the right one.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&ldquo;When one is thirsty, one feels one could drink the ocean&mdash;that is <em>faith</em>; but when one has started drinking, one cannot swallow more than two glasses &mdash;that is <em>science</em>.&rdquo; </p>

<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sample answer to 
  the literary movement question on the Midterm-thanks, Sonia.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Realism is characterized 
  by its lack of flowery language, little<br>
  enamoration with nature, and its prediliction for the scientific method. A<br>
  realist novel is like a mirror going down the street (class notes.) The<br>
  author's job is to describe what is happening and sometimes to arrange<br>
  events in a logical sequence.<br>
  <br>
  Gustave Flaubert spared no details when he discussed the gory details of<br>
  Hippolyte's clubfoot operationg in his novel, <i>Madame Bovary</i>. He was<br>
  vivid in his description of the gangrene, and Hippolyte's doomed<br>
  &quot;convalescense.&quot; The beggar on the highway was also described in graphic<br>
  detail-- his skin problems, missing eyes, and possible scrofula were all<br>
  presented in the text. The character Homais was presented for what he was,<br>
  with judicious comments from the narrator, showing his shallow,<br>
  ambition-grubbing nature.<br>
  <br>
  Leo Tolstoy's<i> Death of Ivan Ilyich</i> is another realistic story. No<br>
  concessions are made to polite society; people are shown exactly as they<br>
  are. When Ivan's dead, his &quot;friends'&quot; motivations are uncovered by 
  teh<br>
  narrator from the start. The smell of Ivan's corpse is not overlooked and<br>
  all of the sensory data in the story are made available to the reader.<br>
  <br>
  Realism is harsher compared to Romanticism; the Romantics valued Nature's<br>
  beauty and mystery. Enlightenment writers valued education and the<br>
  scientific method. It was geared more towards man's greatness than man's<br>
  reality. </font></p>

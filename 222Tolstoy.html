<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Chapter 6: <strong>What is a <font color="#FF0000">syllogism</font>?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism</a></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In traditional logic, a syllogism is an inference in which one proposition (the conclusion) follows of necessity from two others (known as premises). The definition is traditional, but is derived loosely from Aristotle's Prior Analytics, Book I, c. 1. The Greek &quot;sullogismos&quot; means &quot;deduction.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Syllogisms consist of three things: major, minor (the premises) and conclusion, which follows logically from the major and the minor. A major is a general principle. A minor is a specific statement. Logically, the conclusion follows from applying the major to the minor.<br>
  <br>
  For example, this is the classic &quot;Barbara&quot; syllogism, given by Aristotle:<br>
  If all humans (B's) are mortal (A), (major)<br>
  and all Greeks (C's) are humans (B's), (minor)<br>
  then all Greeks (C's) are mortal (A). (conclusion)<br>
  That is,<br>
  All men are mortal. (general principle)<br>
  Socrates is a man. (specific statement)<br>
  Socrates is mortal. (substitution of specific (minor) into general (major))</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">***********</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#133;The conclusion of its syllogism is not that &#147;Caius is mortal&#148; but that you will die&#133;we like P&euml;tr Ivanovich at the funeral, take this &#147;reproach to the living&#148; as somehow &#147;out of place, or at least not applicable to him.&#148; Our reading condemns us. Even if we imagine that we do agree with the story&#146;s lesson, the very fact that we are at that moment reading fiction belies us. The only person in the story to whom its lesson does not apply is the one who could not read it, the peasant Gerasim.<br>

<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Three kinds of 
  irony</strong><br>
&#147;&#133;Tolstoy&#146;s ironies seem to me to be neither Classical (saying 
  one thing while meaning another) nor Romantic (playing upon contrasts between 
  expectation and fulfillment).&#148; Rather it is a Biblical sort of irony that 
  turns &#147;always upon the incongruous clash between incommensurate orders 
  of reality, human and divine, eros and the spirit.&#148;<br>
  -Harold Bloom<br>

  <strong>Ivan?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;He had never known the joy of loving or of being loved. He had never felt the 
      sting of passion or the energy of impulse. He had never experienced the calm 
      pleasure of moral satisfaction such as might come from the consciousness of 
      having been loyal or generous. He had never admired anyone or anything; he had 
      never been interested in anything or anyone, not even, really in himself. He 
      had never questioned or doubted anything, not even himself.&quot;<br>

<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Comments on <em>The Death of Ivan Ilych</em> by Leo Tolstoy by Jerome Groopman MD</strong><br>
This book is foundational in the genre of medical literature. Tolstoy employs a tense, terse prose to portray the powerful psychological defenses we use to cope with mortality. Ivan Ilych, a magistrate who enjoys his absolute control over plaintiffs, suddenly becomes ill. His celebrity physicians are unable to agree on a diagnosis, and have no cure. Tolstoy reveals how severe illness gradually unravels the fabric of Ilych's life; he is rendered powerless and bereft. At the cusp of death, Ilych confronts the awful realization that he has squandered his life by living in response to external expectations, without an inner moral compass. Yet, all is not lost, because at the end he is redeemed by an act of selfless love for his family. Tolstoy's lesson about how to live is best learned while still healthy.</font></p>

  &nbsp;<br>
  <em><strong>comme il faut</strong></em><strong>:</strong> Being in accord with conventions or accepted standards; proper.<br>
  adj : according with custom or propriety; &quot;her becoming modesty&quot;; &quot;comely behavior&quot;; &quot;it is not comme il faut for a gentleman to be constantly asking for money&quot;; &quot;a decent burial&quot;; &quot;seemly behavior&quot; [syn: becoming, comely, decent, decorous, seemly]<br>
  <br>
  <em><strong>ennui</strong></em>: Listlessness and dissatisfaction resulting from lack of interest; boredom: &ldquo;The servants relieved their ennui with gambling and gossip about their masters&rdquo; (John Barth).<br>
&nbsp;[French, from Old French enui, from ennuyer, to annoy, bore. See annoy.]<br>
Word History: Were they alive today, users of Classical Latin might be surprised to find that centuries later a phrase of theirs still survives, although as a single word. The phrase mihi in odi est (literally translated as &ldquo;to me in a condition of dislike or hatred is&rdquo;), meaning &ldquo;I hate or dislike,&rdquo; gave rise to the Vulgar Latin verb *inodire, &ldquo;to make odious,&rdquo; the source of the Old French verb ennuyer or anoier, &ldquo;to annoy, bore.&rdquo; This was borrowed into English by around 1275 as anoien, our annoy. From the Old French verb a noun meaning &ldquo;worry, boredom&rdquo; was derived, which became ennui in modern French. This noun, with the sense &ldquo;boredom,&rdquo; was borrowed into English in the 18th century, perhaps filling a need in polite, cultivated society.</font></p>

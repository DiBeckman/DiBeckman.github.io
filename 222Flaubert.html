<p><strong>Final lecture on Madame Bovary:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Book 3, Chapter 1</strong> <strong>Cathedral and carriage</strong></p>
<p>How ironic that Emma and Leon decide to meet in a sacred space: the Rouen cathedral! At the end of the 19th century, this same Cathedral will be made famous by Claude Monet's <a href="http://www.learn.columbia.edu/monet/swf/">paintings of the Cathedral facade</a> at different times of day, echoing Flaubert's own ironic observation, &quot;There is no truth, only perception.&quot;</p>
<p><span class="class">1367</span>: Leon confuses the church with  Emma's boudoir: a private room off the bedroom where a woman might receive a lover.<br />
  <br />
<span class="class">&quot;Leon was walking near the walls at a measured pace. Never had life seemed so good to him. She was going to come soon, charming and nervous, glancing over her shoulder to see who was looking at her—and with her flounced dress, her gold lorgnette, her thin boots, with all those elegances he had not yet tasted, and with the indescribable allure of virtue seduced. The church like a gigantic boudoir, spread out around her; the arches bent forward to receive in shadows the confession of her love: the windows shone resplendent to illuminate her face, and the censers were going to burn so that she would appear like an angel in the perfumed smoke.&quot; </span></p>
<p>There is some comic relief through the interplay between the verger who insists on showing them the church and Leon who has only love/sex on his mind. </p>
<p>One of the most scandalous and famous scenes in the novel comes when Leon finally succeeds in getting Emma out of the cathedral. The magazine that carried the first run of <em>Madame Bovary</em> actually refused to print this section, even though Flaubert carefully leaves everything that happens inside the carriage up to the reader's imagination.</p>
<p>We see Leon's impatience and Emma's obsession with Paris in the argument he uses to get her in the carriage:</p>
<p><span class="class">1368: &quot;Oh, Léon!…Really…I don't know if I should…!&quot;<br />
She whimpered. Then, in a more serious tone: &quot;It's very improper, don't you know that?&quot;<br />
&quot;How so?&quot; the clerk replied. &quot;They do
it in Paris!&quot;<br />
And that work like an irresistible argument, convinced her.
</span><br />
</p>
<p>The reader is outside the carriage for the rest of the scene. We are like one of the citizens of Rouen or the cab driver who doesn't understand why his client don't get out to look at any of  the tourist spots he drives by. He is thirsty and exhausted, but Léon keeps telling him to go on.</p>
<p class="class">1369: &quot;Once, in the middle of the day, in the open countryside, at the time when the sun beat most fiercely against the old silver-plated lanterns, a naked hand emerged from beneath the little yellow-canvas blinds, and it tossed out some torn-up scraps of paper, which dispersed in the wind and alit further on, like white butterflies, on a field of red clover all in bloom.&quot;</p>
<p>Whose hand? Emma's. What is she throwing out? The &quot;interminable letter&quot; of renunciation she had written Léon (<span class="class">1365</span>). Where have we seen the butterflies before? When she burned her wedding bouquet: <span class="class">1259: &quot;…the paper flower petals, shriveling, swayed against the back of the stove like black butterflies and finally flew up the chimney.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="class">1369: &quot;And then about six o'clock, the cab stopped in a back street in the Beauvoisine Quarter, and a woman got down from it, walking with her veil down and without looking back.&quot; </span>The repeated motif of the veil shows Emma's continuing secrets and subterfuge. She doesn't look back because she has no regrets even though she knows that she is doing wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 2: </strong><strong>Emma returns home after her adventure.</strong><br />
<span class="class">1370: &ldquo;Madame you must go right away to Monsieur Homais&rsquo; house. It&rsquo;s for something urgent.&rdquo;</span> But when Emma tries to get the information from Homais, he&rsquo;s caught giving a tongue-lashing to Justin. <span class="class">1371: &quot;You don't know! Well, I know! You saw a bottle of blue glass, sealed with yellow wax, on which I had written:<em> Dangerous!</em></span> <span class="class">And do you know what was inside? Arsenic! And you went and touched it! And you took a pan that was right next to it!&quot; &quot;Right next to it!&quot; cried Madame Homais, wringing her hands. &quot;Arsenic? You could have poisoned us all!&quot; And the children all began to cry, as if they already felt hideous pains in their entrails.&quot;</span></p>
<p>Homais is supposed to give Emma the news about the death of Charles' father, but what he reveals instead is the existence of the  jar of arsenic, where it is, and who has the key. The <span class="class">hideous pains</span> foreshadow Emma's painful death when she later blackmails Justin into giving her the same arsenic.</p>
<p>Emma shows no sympathy for Charles in his grief, and even lies to him about the violets. Lheureux takes advantage of the couple's distraction to get Emma to take over the family finance, which Emma uses as  an excuse to spend three days in Rouen with Léon.  <br />
</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 3 </strong><br />
  At first their affair goes beautifully. Flaubert describes it in terms of romantic poetry. Mme Rollet now has a new role, as go-between, carrying the lovers' letters. As one critic put it,<br />
&ldquo;Léon and Lheuereux are two extremities of the candle that Emma is burning at both ends.&quot; Emma's hunger for consumer products is matched by Lheureux's greediness. Emma begins to tell lies—she comes up with the excuse of  piano lessons for her trips to Rouen.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 5</strong><br />
In an usual narrative move, Flaubert introduces a new character more than 2/3 of the way through the novel. He is by far the most disturbing character we have met. He is associated with Emma's travels between Rouen and Yonville.</p>
<p class="class">1383: &quot;There was, on the hillside, a poor devil who wandered around with his cane, coming right up to the coaches. A pile of rags covered his shoulders, and a beat-up old beaver hat, round like a bowl, hid his face; but when he pulled it off, he reveaeld two blank, bloody orbits where there should have been eyelids. The flesh on his face peeled in red strips and it oozed liquid matter that hardened into green scales as far down as his nose, whose black nostrils sniffed convulsively. To speak to you, he would throw his head back with an idiot's grin—and then the bluish pupils of his eyes, constantly rolling, would beat up against his temples, at the edge of an open wound.</p>
<p class="class">He would sing a little song while he followed the coaches:<br />
  Often the warmth of a beautiful day<br />
Makes a young girl dream of love.</p>
<p class="class">And all the rest was birds, sunshine, and foliage.&quot;</p>
<p>We haven't seen anything so gruesome since Candide met up with Cunégonde once she was ugly. But Flaubert goes even further in his graphic description of the degradation and humiliation of this disabled outcast. It's a condemnation of a society with no safety-net. Yet the beggar works on another level, too. His song, Romantic poetry lite, seems to refer to Emma. His outer physical corruption is a mirror of Emma's internal moral corruption.</p>
<p><span class="class">1383: &quot;His voice, feeble and quavering at first, would be come shrill. It would echo through the night, like an indistinct lamentation over same vague distress; and coming to her across the ringing of bells, the murmur of the trees, and the rumblings of the empty vehicle, it had a far-off sound that overwhelmed Emma. It drove down into the depths of her soul like a whirlwind into an abyss and carried her along with it into a borderless, melancholy region.&quot;</span><br />
  <br />
Was this the sound we heard when Emma first gave herself to Rodolphe (<span class="class">1317</span>)? It's certainly another possibility.</p>
<p>Emma starts  a new alarming habit: compulsive lying. She fools Charles about the piano teacher and seems unable to stop. Flaubert now shows us where he was going with the imagery of the veil. <span class="class">1385 &quot;From that moment on, her existence was nothing more than a long tissue of lies, in which she enveloped her love as if under a veil, to keep it hidden. It was a need, a mania, a pleasure—to the point where, if  she said that she had walked down the right side of the street yesterday, you would have to believe that she had gone down the left.&quot;</span></p>
<p>Lheureux gets Emma to sign more notes. Madame Bovary Senior continues to see  though her daughter-in-law's tricks, but Emma gets Charles to turn against his mother. She grows bolder with Leon, and we see their gender role reversal again: <span class="class">1390: &ldquo;He did not question her ideas; he accepted all her tastes: he  became her mistress, more than she was his. She had tender words and kisses that swept his soul away. But where had she learned this corruption, so profound and so deeply disguised that it seemed almost spiritual?&quot;</span> Flaubert doesn't answer this question, but he portrays the truth of it beautifully.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 6</strong><br />
  When Homais comes to Rouen, Léon is trapped, and he and Emma have their first big fight. Emma's resentment of Leon is put in frankly anti-female terms! <span class="class">1392: &quot;She had just left, infuriated. She hated him now. This failure to keep his word about their rendez-vous seemed an insult to her, and she was trying to think of other reasons to break it off with him: he was incapable of heroism ,weak, banal, more spineless than a woman, a tightwad besides and cowardly.&quot; </span></p>
<p>Emma is unwilling to give up her romantic delusions that Léon will bring her the happiness that she is convinced is  just around the corner. Read the following passge out loud. Even in translation, Flaubert's use of alliteration is powerful. <span class="class">1393: &quot;She always promised herself that her next trip would bring her profound happiness; but then she would have to admit she felt nothing extraordinary. The disillusionment would be erased by new hope, and Emma would return to him more impassioned, more ardent. She would undress brutally, tearing off the thin laces of her corset, which would hiss like a snake as it slipped over her hips.&quot;</span> The sibilant s sounds reinforce the simile of the snake, and make the reader think of the Serpent in the Garden of Eden, tempting Eve to sin.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, her financial situation gets worse.  <span class="class">1396: &quot; The house was sad enough nowadays! Tradesmen were seen leaving it with angry looks on their faces. There were handkerchiefs left lying on the stoves, and little Berthe, to the grade scandal of Madame Homais, was wearing stockings with holes in them.&quot; </span>The house itself becomes a symbol of Emma's betrayal of her role as homemaker and mother.</p>
<p>Inevitably, Emma even grows tired of her affair with her soul mate, Léon. If I had been Flaubert's lawyer when he was taken to court for blasphemy and obsensity in this novel, I would quote this passage to prove that Flaubert was hardly glorifying adultery! <span class="class">1398: &quot;They knew</span> <span class="class">each other too well by now for any of those sensual surprises that multiply the joy of possession. She was as disgusted with him as he was tired of her. Emma was discovering in adultery all the dreary monotonies of marriage.&quot;</span> As far as I know, no author has been taken to court for making marriage look bad!</p>
<p>Finally comes the confrontation between Emma and Lheureux in the final lines of Chapter 6: <span class="class">1400</span>: <span class="class">&quot;I beg you, Monsieur Lheureux, just a few more days!&quot; She was sobbing. &quot;Of course, tears now!&quot; &quot;You're making me desperate!&quot; &quot;I couldn't care less!&quot; he said, closing the door on her.&quot; </span>Have we met a character more heartless since Hermann pulled a gun on the Countess?</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 7. </strong><br /> 
The bailiff comes to do the household inventory, which  becomes a kind of autopsy of Emma's life. <span class="class">1401: They examined her dresses, the linen, the dressing room, and her whole existence, right down to its most intimate details, was spread out before these three men like a corpse for an autopsy.&quot;</span> Once again, the simile is so appropriate as a reminder of Charles and his lack of success as a surgeon.</p>
<p>This chapter is the opposite of awards at the Agricultural Fair, which were the high point of rural prosperity. This is the low point. Note also that it is the secondary capitalists, the money-lenders, the lawyers, the bankers and tax collectors, that do Emma in. And of course, Charles still has no idea what's going on.<br />
  <br />
  Who does she turn to in order to try to get the money?<br />
</p>
<p>1) The local bankers, who laugh in her face.<br />
  2) Léon.  Does he help? No. He says he will, later, and she is upset enough to believe him. <br />
3) Then, walking by the Cathedral on the way to catch the coach home, she imagines that she sees her dance partner at the Ball. <span class="class">1403:&quot;It was him, the Viscount!</span> <span class="class">She turned around; the street was deserted. And she was so overcome, so sorrowful, that she had to learn against a wall to keep from falling down. But then she thought she was mistaken. Besides she wasn't sure of anything anymore. Everything, both within her and outside of her was abandoning her. She felt herself lost and falling beyond control into indefinable abysses; and it was almost with joy that she caught sight of the good Homais when she reached the Red Cross inn…&quot;<br />
</span><br />
  Flaubert has used the imagery of peaks and abysses, as here, to suggest the highs and lows of Emma's bipolarity. 
We know that someone must be at the end of her rope if she is glad to see &quot;the good Homais&quot;!  </p>
<p>Once again, the beggar is there to accompany them on their return to Yonville. 1<span class="class">404: &quot;The blind man sank down on his haunches, and his head thrown back, rolling his greenish eyes and sticking out his tongue, he rubbed his stomach with both hands while he emitted a sort of low howl like a starving dog. Emma, filled with disgust, tossed him a five-franc piece over her shoulder. It was the entirety of her fortune.&quot; It seemed a fine thing to her, throwing it away like that.&quot;</span> Ironically, both she and Homais reveal their own distorted views of themselves as they offer useless advice (Homais) and money (both of them) to the miserable wretch. The reader hasn't yet noticed how similar she and Homais are.<br />
  <br />
4) Next, on Felicité's advice she goes to see the notary, Guillaumin, whose house was actually one of the very first buildings we saw in Yonville, where it was described as <span class="class">&quot;the finest in in the area&quot;</span> <span class="class">(1261).</span> Emma is greeted by the butler, Théodore, who is  Félécité's romantic interest, and obviously knows the whole story. To understand Emma, you have to see appreciate my favorite line in the entire novel, as we see the notary's house through her eyes. Here she is, her household goods up for auction, and what  goes through her mind? <span class="class">1404: &quot;This is the kind of dining room,&quot; Emma thought, &quot;that I ought to have.&quot; </span>She is convinced to the end that she deserves only the best. </p>
<p> When she tells her story to the notary, he knows it all already. He is the spider at the center of the web that has ensnared her through his agent, Lheureux. Maître Guillamin has an idea of what she can exchange for his financial help. Emma's reaction? Indignation! <span class="class">1406: &quot;You're trying to profit from my distress, Monsieur! I'm to be pitied, not to be sold!&quot;</span> Flaubert get the reader to wonder whether that is true. <br />
  </p>
<p>5) Next, it's Binet's turn. Emma  sneaks out of the house to avoid a confrontation with Charles. The thought of Charles' forgiveness of <em>her</em> crimes against him and their daughter infuriates her. <span class="class">1407: &quot;Yes, she muttered through clenched teeth, &quot;he will forgive me, he who couldn't purchase my forgiveness for having known me if he had a million… Never! Never!&quot;</span> Apparently, Emma's perverse resentment of Charles  knows no limits. As always, she refused to accept personal responsibility. Flaubert&rsquo;s narrative subtlety continues as we witness Emma's attempt to get Binet's help just like one of the neighborhood snoops. Once again, Emma is connected with a serpent: <span class="class">1408&quot;…the tax collector…suddenly as if he had seen a snake, jumped back and cried out…'Madame! What are you thinking?' &quot;</span></p>
<p>6) Finally Emma goes to Madame Rollet's to wait for Leon who will never come to help her. She thinks she hears Binet&rsquo;s lathe turning, like the wheel of fortune. Then she gets one more idea of where she might turn for help<strong></strong>. Flaubert is blunt in his assessment of her hypocrisy here. <span class="class">1410:</span> <span class="class">&quot;So she left for La Huchette, without perceiving that she was now hurrying to offer the very thing that had so horrified her earlier that same day, nor did she suspect in the least that she was prostituting herself.&quot;</span></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 8.</strong> But once Rodolphe realizes that she's there for money, he rejects her, like all the others. This rejection, though, pushes Emma into  madness. <span class="class">1413: &quot;Madness seized her, she was afraid, and she succeeded in getting hold of herself, but in fact only in a confused way; for she could not at all remember the cause of her terrifying state—that is, the money issue. Her only suffering was from her love, and she could feel her soul slipping away from her in that memory, like the mortally injured who feel their lives leaving them through their bleeding wounds.&quot;</span> Flaubert's imagery here portrays Emma like a soldier, ready to sacrifice herself for a noble cause. <span class="class">&quot;Then her situation presented itself to her like an abyss. She panted hard enough to burst her chest. Then, in a heroic exaltation that made her almost joyful, she ran down the hillside, crossed the cow bridge, the path</span>, <span class="class">the lane, the marketplace, and arrived in front of the pharmacist's shop.&quot;</span> We haven't seen these words used for Emma before: <span class="class">heroic, joyous</span>. She lies and uses Justin's infatuation with her and fear of Monsieur Homais to blackmail the young man into giving her the arsenic. She eats it greedily in front of him. In the final line before the page break, we see two more words we haven't seen in connection with Emma before: <span class="class">serene</span> and <span class="class">duty</span>. All we have seen her care about is her own passion and her pleasure. <span class="class">&quot;Then she turned around, suddenly feeling relieved, almost serene with the feeling of having completed a duty.&quot; </span></p>
<p>She still hasn&rsquo;t confessed to Charles. Instead of telling him, she sits down and writes her last letter: suicide note. A romantic, through and through, she thinks she's going to have a very peaceful death, but no… Flaubert's realism won't allow that. In fact, the author actually tasted arsenic himself so that he could give an accurate description of her horrific symptoms.</p>
<p><span class="class">1415: &quot;Drops of sweat were oozing from her bluish face, which was stiffening now as if some metallic vapor were exhaling itself from inside her. Her teeth were chattering, her wide-open eyes were gazing vaguely all around her, and to every question her only reply was to nod her head; she even smiled two or three times. Bit by bit her moans grew stronger. A low howl burst from her; she claimed that she was feeling better and that she would get up soon. But she was seized by convulsions; she cried out: &quot;Oh, it's horrible, my God.&quot; He threw himself down on his knees against the bed. &quot;Speak! What did you eat? Answer me in the name of God!&quot; And he looked at her with a tenderness in his eyes like nothing she had ever known.&quot;</span></p>
<p>In addition to the graphic details of the poisoning, Flaubert gives us here one of the most ironic lines of the novel. All her life, Emma has been searching for total, unconditional love. She doesn't recognize that it has been right in front of her  until it is too late! If she weren't dying, would she be able to find what she needs in her own husband? Flaubert leaves that up to the reader to decide.<br />
</p>
<p>The wonderful scene where Abbé Bournesien comes to minister to Emma on her deathbed is another one of the passages at issue when Flaubert and his publisher were taken to trial. Flaubert insisted that he took the details of the final Catholic rites directly from church literature. But that's doing disservice to his artistry here.</p>
<p class="class">1420: The priest rose to pick up the crucifix; and she stretched out her neck like someone thirsting, and pressing her lips to the body of the Man-God with all her dying powers, she placed the most loving kiss she had ever given. He went on to recite the <em>Miseratur</em> and the <em>Indulgentiam</em>, dipped his right thumb in the oil, and began the unctions: first upon the eyes, which had so lusted after earthly luxuries; then upon the nostrils, so fond of warm breezes and amorous scents; then upon the mouth, which had opened to lie, which had moaned with pride and cried out in sensuality; then upon the hands, which had delighted in lustful contact; and finally, upon the soles of the feet, so swift in the past when she had run to satisfy her desires, and which now would never walk again.</p>
<p>In Book 1, Chapter 6, Flaubert  traced the origins of Emma's confusion between faith and sensuality, which leads up to this &quot;<span class="class">most loving kiss she had ever given</span>&quot;. Flaubert also beautifully intertwines the five senses, <strong>sight, smell, taste, hearing, touch</strong>, with seven deadly sins: <strong>lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy </strong>and<strong> pride</strong>. We have watched Emma commit each sin   to her best and most sensual ability.<br />
</p>
<p>The final irony in her remaining moments comes when she hears--or imagines that she hears--the blind man outside her window. How did he get to Yonville? It's a mightly long walk.</p>
<p><span class="class">1421: &quot;The blind man!&quot; she cried. And Emma began to laugh, a horrible laugh, frenetic and despairing, believing she could see the hideous face of the beggar, standing out against the eternal shadows like a sudden terror.<br />
  The wind was plenty strong that day,<br />
  And up her short skirt blew!<br />
  A convulsion seized her and threw her back upon the mattress. They all drew closer to her. She was no longer living.&quot;
  </span><br />
  <br />
It is hard to imagine a more grim and brutally realistic death than Emma's, so unlike the romantic escape she imagined when she swallowed the arsenic. Her horrible laughs have scholars in disagreement. Has she lost her mind? Does she have a moment of insight into her own corruption? Like the winking Countess in Queen of Spades, it's not hard to interpret the beggar here as a supernatural figure of Death, in this case, the Grim Reaper, who sings his song of scythes and skirts blowing in the breeze. </p>
<p> It's a testimony to Flaubert's view of realism that he doesn't end the story with Emma's death. Since human beings are a product of society, we know have to see how this death affects each of the other characters, for each has a role to play. Of course, Homais denies his involvement and responsibility. Charles insists on burying Emma in three coffins, one inside the other, like the layers of the hat, the cake, the tissue of lies that Emma wore like veils. The funeral scene Book 3, Chapter 10, is a mirror of the wedding scene, Book 1, Chapter 4. Hippolyte finally has the occasion to wear his fancy leg. Léon and Rodolphe stay away. Justin cries. After the funeral, the villagers and Rouennais take advantage of Charles, who has precious little left. Even after her death, Emma continues to affect him, and not for the better. 1431:<span class="class"> &quot;To please her—as if she were stil alive—he adopted her tastes, her ideas; he bought patent leather boots, he began wearing white cravats. He put cosmetics on his moustache, and like her</span>, <span class="class">signed promissory notes. She was corrupting him from beyond the grave.&quot;</span><br />
</p>
<p>The descent of Charles is matched by the ascendancy of Homais who gets the blind beggar committed and whose family thrives as Charles&rsquo; disintegrates. The motif of letters continues as Charles opens the secret drawer in her desk and finally learns the truth about his wife. One day when Charles goes to town to sell his old horse—his last asset—he meets Rodolphe. After some awkward moment, Charles even forgives him. In an echo of the break-up letter that Rodolphe had sent Emma, Charles attributes what happened to &quot;FATE.&quot; The next day, Charles falls asleep and dies on the bench where Emma used to meet her lovers. Who finds him? His daughter, Berthe. What might we put on the death certificate? A broken heart?</p>
<p>Like the end of <em>The Queen of Spades</em>, the novel finishes with final disposition of all the characters. The Industrial Revolution claims Berthe. She goes to work in the cotton mill, a grim life so different than the one her mother had or the one her father dreamed for her. The final sentence of the novel delivers the final irony. Homais has managed to get himself the Legion of Honor, the highest award of the French government. Clearly Flaubert is horrified by middle-class society. He ends his novel awarding this prize to the least-deserving character in the novel. Homais is as deceitful as Emma, as timid as Léon, and selfish as Rodolphe, with no sense of beauty or truth. He represents the triumph of hypocrisy and self-promotion. He thinks only of appearances and promoting himself. Think how far we've come from the excitement in the Enlightenment—from spreading new ideas to spreading lies, all the way to the top of the heap. </p>
<p>See you on Wednesday!</p>

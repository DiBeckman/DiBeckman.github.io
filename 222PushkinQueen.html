<p align="left" class="style1"><br /> 
1. <em>Lost in Translation<br />
</em>by Nick Otte </p>
<p align="center" class="style1"><br />
  <span class="style2"><em>Upon the brink of the wild stream<br />
  He stood, and dreamt a mighty dream<br />
  Alexander Pushkin</em></span></p>
<p align="left" class="style1"><span class="style2">As Hermann walked out of the door of Chekalinsky&rsquo;s house, a horrible realization came upon him.  He had lost it all.  He had once been too smart to risk all his money but times had changed, the cards had changed and the secret was lost.  Hermann could feel his whole body tremble.  It didn&rsquo;t stop.  Hermann fell to his knees, unable to stand. <br />
    <br />
&ldquo;Three, Seven, Ace!&rdquo; Hermann thought as he fell unconscious. <br />
<br />
The people outside took no notice of him, for they did not believe it was serious.  Hermann&rsquo;s face hit the snow, but he could not feel the cold, wet snow cover his face, he lay there, unable to comprehend anything that had befallen him. <br />
<br />
As Hermann lay there, Lisaveta Ivanovna walked down the stairs into the hallway of the Countess&rsquo; house.  The morning had been so grim, the funeral and receiving guests had taken their toll on her.  She felt the same as she always had, but something was different.  Lisaveta looked forward to the days to come.  Had the Countess&rsquo; death brought her joy, but how could she feel this way about a family member? <br />
<br />
As Lisaveta stood and admired the moonlight, one of the stewards who was dressed in all black with a stout posture approached her and asked &ldquo;Why so grim darling?&rdquo;<br /> 
<br />
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Lisaveta retorted unsure of how to act in front of the bothersome woman. <br />
<br />
&ldquo;How is it that such a beautiful girl like you standing here all alone?&rdquo; the steward asked.  Lisaveta thought but she knew not to answer the servant&rsquo;s firm questioning.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;I would like very much to introduce you to my son, he is in the service&rdquo; the servant replied answering her own question.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Is he an Engineer?&rdquo; Lisaveta replied.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;No, no, no&rdquo; the servant said, &ldquo;he is in the infantry, and he is a good man in need of a wife who will please him.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
&ldquo;But I am not sure if I can please anyone&rdquo; Lisaveta replied nervously.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Silly girl, meet me outside of the kitchen at midnight tonight, and I will take you to meet him&rdquo; the servant ordered, and walked off as if to not give Lisaveta the chance to respond.<br />
<br />
As the astute woman walked off she muttered to herself &ldquo;now it is truly a possibility for my son to make a name for our family and we can become nobles like we ought to be.&rdquo;  Lisaveta could not hear the woman&rsquo;s incriminating remarks; instead she was anticipating her encounter that was to occur later on that night.<br />
<br />
The next night at Chekalinsky&rsquo;s manor, a ball was held in honor of the Countess.  There were many wealthy nobles congregating on the floor, dancing to the gracious music.  Yet Tomsky went to sit, for he was worn out from the dancing.  Unfortunately for him the alcohol was wearing off.  He thought he was finished for the night, but just as he became comfortable, several young ladies came rushing up to him in a discreetly eager fashion.  Princess Polina was amongst the group of suitors, appealing to Tomsky to dance with them next.  Tomsky had been dancing through the night with several of the ladies, but now it was time for him to court one that had a slight advantage over the rest.  Tomsky took Princess Polina&rsquo;s hand.  Tomsky was an elegant dancer, with his impressive strength and unmatched grace in movement.  Princess Polina might not have been the prettiest lady at the ball, but she was surely the richest one. <br />
<br />
Tomsky was not one for love, but rather his personal potential gain.  So as he waltzed his way into Princess Polina&rsquo;s heart, he knew exactly how he would spend the rest of his life, rich. <br />
<em><br />
Hermann went mad.  He is now installed in Room 17 at the Obukhov Hospital; he answers no questions, but merely mutters with unusual rapidity: &ldquo;Three, seven, ace! Three, seven, queen!&rdquo;<br />
Lisaveta Ivanovna has married the very agreeable young man, who has a good position in the service somewhere.  Lisaveta Ivanovna is bringing up a poor relative.<br />
Tomsky has been promoted to the rank of Captain, and is going to marry Princess Polina.</em></span></p>
<p align="left" class="style1">2. <em>Retribution </em></p>
<p align="left" class="style1">By Jay Cope</p>
<p align="left">Hermann went through his daily routine of sitting upon his cot muttering whispers of ancient cards from a distant life. &ldquo;Three, Seven, Ace! Three, Seven, Queen!&rdquo;  Reflecting on the year, it dawned upon him that it was his eleventh year in this white-walled sanctuary he called home. &ldquo;Ironic&rdquo; he thought &ldquo;The Queen is the eleventh card in a deck.&rdquo; There was a knock at the door and then it opened. It was time to go for his daily walk in the gardens outside. While walking the lush green paths, Hermann was still contemplating the eleventh card when an all too familiar chill crawled down his spine. Hermann stopped cold in his tracks, his heart turned to stone. Hermann heared a whisper through the trees, &ldquo;I come here against my will.&rdquo; This was all that was spoken. Something in Hermann snapped. He took off in a dead sprint. Quickly he found the outer walls to the ward. He scampered up a tree overlooking the ward walls. He ran through the woods for hours, still hearing the whispers. At about a quarter till three in the morning, Hermann walked into a small village where he was fortunate enough to find some neighborly people whom took him in for the rest of night and didn&rsquo;t wake him for most of the next day. <br />
  <br />
  When he woke up, he once again felt the cold chill down his back. He heard slippers scuffling down the hall, coming toward him. He froze in his bed. His door slowly opened with a creak. It was the old woman! Herman was speechless, but the countess began to speak. &ldquo;Go to Petersburg and play the cards.&rdquo; Just like that she was gone, with a fainting whisper echoing into the walls, &ldquo;Play the cards.&rdquo; Hermann was in disbelief. As soon as he could gather himself, he found his way out of his bed and the house without pausing to thank his generous caretakers. The first carriage he saw he flagged them down and asked, &ldquo;Good sir, could you not give a poor old fellow a ride to nearby Petersburg?&rdquo; The stagecoach driver relented, asking him to ride atop the luggage on the back. When Hermann arrived in Petersburg he was let off in the wealthy side of town. He came across a magnificent town house. Just then he heard the familiar voice &ldquo;Play the cards,&rdquo; upon hearing this he ducked into the house . &ldquo;The servants must be around back&rdquo; he thought as he saw reflections off the cabinet beneath the mirror on the far wall. He ventured up to the master bedroom and fumbled through the belongings of the home owner. Suddenly Hermann&rsquo;s eyes lit up. A bank note worth 50,000 roubles! Hermann put it into his pocket and dashed out of the house without even being seen. When Hermann left the home his first order of business was to find something more respectable to dress in, after all he didn&rsquo;t want to go into the public gaming house looking like destitute. Hermann found an open tailor shop and had a new suit put on him using some of the money he had just found.<br />
  <br />
  That evening, Hermann was having a cup of tea in the caf&eacute;. He was watching the towns folk walk down the busy city streets when his eye was struck by a familiar face, &ldquo;Ah yes I recognize this face, it is an older Mrs. Ivanovna.&rdquo; Hermann walked up to the woman, when she noticed him her eyes widened and she became stiff. &ldquo;Hello Lisaveta&rdquo; Hermann said. &ldquo;Do you remember who I am?&rdquo; She stood speechless, a hint of terror in her eyes, as if she had seen a ghost. &ldquo;It is I, Hermann; surely you remember this old German!&rdquo; Hermann prodded. &ldquo;Oh yes, I had thought your face seemed eerily familiar. What are you doing here in Petersburg?&rdquo; Lisaveta retorted. &ldquo;Well a small fortune has been bestowed upon me by the powers above and I was on my way to the gaming house.&rdquo; Hermann paused. &ldquo;Would you be so kind as to join me?&rdquo; said Hermann. &ldquo;I see that nothing has changed with you, perhaps that fortune you speak of was more you&rsquo;re doing then any supernatural luck, further more I am a married woman now, to an agreeable man who has a good and respectable position in the service, I cannot gallivant about with a madman like you.&rdquo; Lisaveta said. &ldquo;Well indeed you may regret your obtuse stance soon, good day to you Lisaveta.&rdquo; Hermann said as he tipped his hat and walked toward the door.<br />
  <br />
  As Hermann walked down the street, watching the street lamps flicker, he pondered his encounter with Mrs. Ivanovna. His memory filled with that night he had told her that the countess had died at the sight of his pistol. He remembers that night as if it were yesterday. He thought of how much life had changed since then. &ldquo;Oh how life could have been so much different, if only the queen had not gotten me.&rdquo; He thought to himself. &ldquo;Things will be different this time&rdquo; he said with a half cocked smile on his face.<br />
  <br />
  Hermann quickly made it down the cobblestone street and to the game house. He entered the door and found the feature table. After observing the game for a little while, he decided to place a stake. The dealer consented and asked how much he would like to place. Hermann handed him his card and the dealer scoffed at him. &ldquo;Please good sir, if you are looking to make jest, please take it to another game house.&rdquo; Hermann said nothing, he simply took out the bank note the countess had led him to and placed it on the table. You could hear the whole table gasp as he took a seat in a recently vacated chair. Hermann was restrained for the first few games. Suddenly he noticed his blood run cold, and a tingle crept up his spine. &ldquo;Three, Seven, Ace!&rdquo; Hermann heard in his ear. He jerked around, nearly throwing his chair over in the process. He saw no being there. As he returned to face the table, he noticed that everyone at the table was looking at him. &ldquo;I fold&rdquo; he said. The next hand showed a four and a three. Hermann won the hand with a pair of threes. He felt invigorated, a feeling he had not felt since&hellip;<br />
  <br />
  By this time a crowd was forming around the table to observe the high stakes game that was on going. Hermann folded a few more hands and then suddenly got the cold tingling feeling in his neck and decided to play. A knave and a seven showed up, Hermann won again on this pair of sevens. A noticeable smile crept onto his face. He got a since of calm, like watching the river move on a windless day. By this time he had already tripled his fortune and all play in the game house had ceased. The guest all came to watch such uncommon play at the feature table. In the next hand, Hermann&rsquo;s eyes widened in disbelief, it was a queen and an ace. He double checked the ace and he laid it down and jumped up in excitement as he had won the hand  and the feature table. &ldquo;Hold on just a min&rdquo; said the dealer. As if something out of a horrible nightmare, &ldquo;your queen lost good sir.&rdquo; The words struck like a cold stake through Hermann&rsquo;s heart. He ran out of the game house screaming hysterically. As he ran out onto the street a flash of light caught his eye. It was the countess to his left. He turned to face her. She had a smile that covered her face. He was frozen in place as if her eyes had some invisible lock on his whole body. At that moment, someone yelled, &ldquo;Watch out!&rdquo; At that very instant a carriage was streaking down the street. Neither the carriage nor Hermann was able to yield.<br />
  <br />
When the driver of the carriage finally was able to come to a halt, the passenger got out seeing whom they had hit. As Lisaveta exited the carriage she was struck in horror as she realized whom they had murdered. Then a smile came over her face as she realized the countess was finally able to get retribution for her death. To this day people whisper about a Napoleon German engineer that tried his luck twice only to lose to his own financial obsessions. Lisaveta thought &ldquo;maybe I could have saved him. Was he worth saving?&rdquo;</p>

<p>3. Rewriting the end<br />
  <span class="style1">The Queen of Spades</span> by Alexander Pushkin, <span class="style1">Ending</span> by Niyati Mody</p>
<p> <em>Each opened a pack of cards.  Chekalinsky shuffled.  Hermann took a card and covered it with a pile of  bank-notes.  It was like a duel.  Deep silence reigned around. <br />
  Checkanlisky began to deal, his hands trembled. (pg. 819) </em><br />
  <br />
  As the cards were distributed, someone in the rear of the room advanced forward to get a closer glimpse of the game.   Hermann paid no attention to this incident.  Hermann thought that it was merely viewers in the room wanting to witness the unprecedented win.  A few moments afterwards he heard the words &ldquo;Three, seven, ace&rdquo;. With these words, he turned around swiftly and saw the women in white gliding rapidly across the room and she stood before him&mdash;and Hermann recognized the Countess!<br />
  <br />
  &ldquo;<em>I have come to you against my will</em>,&rdquo; she said in a firm voice: &ldquo;but I must make sure that you follow my conditions. If you follow the conditions that I have laid for you, I shall show you the path for discovering the gold hidden by the nomads of Scythia.&rdquo;<br />
  <br />
  With these words, The Countess vanished.  <em>Chekalinsky began to deal; his hands trembled. On the right an Ace turned up, and on the left a Queen.  &quot;Ace has won!&quot; cried Hermann, showing his card.  &quot;Your queen has lost,&quot; Chekalinsky started; instead of an ace, there lay before him the queen of spades! He could not believe his eyes, nor could he understand how he had made such a mistake. </em><br />
  <br />
  CHAPTER SEVEN<br />
  <br />
  A man who loves money more than life;<br />
  Embraces destruction before death.<br />
  <br />
  Mody1 <br />
1	Written by Niyati Mody, believes that a person who values money before another&rsquo;s life is entitled to see his wealth&rsquo;s destroyed  before dying. </p>
<p>Immediately after his win, Hermann took a cab back to Petersburg.  He ascended the staircase of the former Countess&rsquo;s house.  Lisaveta Ivanonvna was sitting in her tiny, ill-lit room, still in tears, lost in deep thought.  Hermann entered the room, while Lisaveta looked out the window.  &ldquo;I have won the game. Do not mind my foolish acts, but I must marry you within twenty-four hours, I do not have time to explain now.&rdquo; Hermann cried. <em>&ldquo;You are a monster!&rdquo; said Lisaveta.</em> <br />
  <br />
  &ldquo;I do not doubt that I deserve that name, but if you marry me, I promise keep you healthy, love you heartily and provide you with the riches of the world&rdquo; Hermann said proudly.  After a pause, Hermann asked &ldquo;Will you marry me?&rdquo;  He stopped and awaited her answer with trepidation.  She ran across the room and fell into his arms. <br />
  <br />
  Hermann and Lisaveta visited the Saint John&rsquo;s Church the very next day and married hastily.  At night, Hermann told Lisaveta about his encounter with the Countess during the game played in Moscow.  Lisaveta assured him that she would stay on his side, even if they have to travel all of Russia.  Two nights later, Hermann quivered like a tiger as he awaited countess&rsquo;s next apparition.  A week passed; there were no encounters with the Countess.  Lisaveta and Hermann decided that Countess would come to them only after they had started their trip.  They set to travel south towards Ryazan, in the regions where the Scythians flourished.<br />
  <br />
  They spent their money living in the most exotic hotels and enjoying delicious meals.  It was Ryazan, then Penza and Saratov, of course Samara and then finally Orenburg.  The streets of Orenburg cried with Kazakhstan&rsquo;s arid air. <br />
  <br />
  They travelled all over the regions of Scythia, and there in the streets of Orenburg they sat in the midst of dust and dusky atmosphere, waiting for anyone to approach.   Hermann spent his money on living in exotic hotels and delicious meals while hunting for Scythian treasure.  There, sitting on the roadside of Pugachev Street, Hermann and Lisaveta waiting patiently for The Countess ****.    A woman roughly of 80 years of age passed and generously put three rubles in the brittle cup that lay before Hermann and Lisaveta.  At that moment it seemed to them that the double-headed eagle winked at Hermann and Lisaveta  and smiled.  They were struck by an unusual likeness&hellip;<br />
  <br />
  &ldquo;The Old woman!&rdquo; Hermann shouted in terror. <br />
  <br />
  The woman walked on as though nothing had happened. <br />
  <br />
  CONCLUSION<br />
Hermann and Lisaveta are beggers on the streets of Orenburg.  Tomsky has been promote to the rank of Captain, and is going to marry Princess Polina. </p>

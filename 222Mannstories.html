<p align="center" class="style1">1) <em>Tadzio&rsquo;s Reflection</em><br />
  by Ashely Whaley </p>
<p align="left" class="style1"><span class="style2"><em>Tadzio and three or four other playmates that still remained were active in front of his family&rsquo;s cabana to Aschenbach&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; The game seemed to have no rules and quickly degenerated.&nbsp; The sturdy boy with the belted suit and the black, slicked-down hair who was called Yashu, angered and blinded by sand thrown in his face, forced Tadzio into a wrestling match, which ended swiftly with the defeat of the weaker, lovely boy.&nbsp; The winner would not release his defeated opponent but instead kneeled on his back and pushed his face in the sand, persisting for so long that Tadzio, already out of breath from the fight, seemed in danger of suffocating .&nbsp; </em>When released Tadzio moved sullenly away from his playmate and towards the crystal bay.&nbsp; <em>He lingered at the edge of the sea with his head hung down, drawing figures in the wet sand with his toe.&nbsp; Then he went into the shallows, which at their deepest point did not wet to his knees, strode through them, and progressed idly to the sandbar </em>.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  Cheerful cries echoed in his ears, charged from behind Tadzio in lyrical notes when Yashu sang his apologies and beckoned him back to play.&nbsp; But soon, there was another voice that encroached upon his reverie.&nbsp; The tones were well-aged and faint, rasping from the sting of illness; it came over him abruptly, and left him unsettled in emotions and spirits.&nbsp; <em>Suddenly, as if prompted by a memory or an impulse</em> Tadzio turned towards the shore, his eyes actively seeking the source of that ghostly voice.&nbsp; That is when downy eyes caught sight of Aschenbach beneath his umbrella; his pale face sank slowly for his breast, and the weight of a foreign sleep smoothed the wrinkles from his brow.<br />
  <br />
  Tadzio did not know what to make of the death of the old gentleman.&nbsp; He had been the first to see the old man pass in what appeared to be peace, from his place amidst the gentle fall and sway of ocean waves.&nbsp; The words to call back to his dear playmate had been fresh upon his tongue if to make those apologies stop; but now they were quite sour, the bitter taste of sea salt left in their wake as a laughing wave caught him off-guard.&nbsp; The black-haired boy caught up with Tadzio, and in a few polite words tried to rouse him from his daze.&nbsp; But as an observer Tadzio could not lift his eyes from the slack-jawed omen of death that Aschenbach presented him with.&nbsp; The sounds of barking replaced those of birds&rsquo; lullabies overhead, the old gentleman&rsquo;s hands opened to the blazing sky, his soul surely on its way to the Underworld.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
These passing weeks had filled him with an unnatural spirit.&nbsp; Tadzio had fully engaged himself in the game Aschenbach had silently presented to him one afternoon; the two had been trapped since then for weeks of pursuit without being caught.&nbsp; Though the rules were never discussed between them, Tadzio knew he was meant to run from the old gentleman; Aschenbach, then, would faithfully chase him.&nbsp; He sensed it gave the old man a certain amount of pleasure to stroll the streets and avenues behind his family, when Tadzio perused the piazza on Sundays after mass, and for those spells his family took on the beach during morning&rsquo;s low tide.&nbsp; He had noticed the gentleman one day when he caught Aschenbach&rsquo;s stare from across the room, guided by the red scarf that adorned the neck of a woman diagonal to him.&nbsp; From that day onward he often stole glances about
him to see if Aschenbach was near.&nbsp; Almost certainly he saw the old gentleman from a distance away with his head nestled into the thick layers of his neckerchief, as Aschenbach gave an obscure prayer to what might have been Apollo for his salvation.&nbsp; But Tadzio could not have been further from the truth about his new playmate.&nbsp; It was the stranger god that had a firm grip on Aschenbach&rsquo;s shoulder, disguised in the light that filtered through large windows.&nbsp; His whispered words that Tadzio mistook for prayers to Apollo were really meant to Dionysus, the covenant sealed when Aschenbach imbibed his syrupy red slurry and watched the boy from that great distance.<br />
<br />
It had taken a great amount of persuasion on Tadzio&rsquo;s part to convince his nurses to let him outdoors for these extended periods.&nbsp; He was frail, and his body weakened with every day that passed, knowing that some hour quite soon it would abandon him entirely.&nbsp; The game he and Aschenbach played had renewed some of his feeble strength, bathed in Apollo&rsquo;s glory as the rays of life shone brightly for him.&nbsp; It restored him like the Venice sun had done, the trip to the Italian seaside meant for Tadzio to find more light and perhaps a healing strength.&nbsp; But it was almost instantly Tadzio felt the effects of the other&rsquo;s death on his conscience; the ache that rattled in his limbs returned, and his cheeks and skin became grey with persistent illness, dizzy as he reeled and heat blazed in his forehead.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  The day continued forward as if nothing had even occurred.&nbsp; The hotel clerk made certain the employment kept silent about Aschenbach&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; Tadzio&rsquo;s pale face was no longer seen with his Narcissus-like smile, and his spirits dissipated.&nbsp; Had he won the game?&nbsp; If so, what was his prize?&nbsp; Where was the old gentleman to congratulate him on
  his success?&nbsp; Why couldn&rsquo;t he have held out long enough for them to speak?&nbsp; Tadzio had not even the chance to tell Aschenbach how these past few weeks left him feeling towards the other.&nbsp; He viewed in all seriousness that the older man was like a grandfather to him; that was the only thing he desired in his life.&nbsp; His mother&rsquo;s father passed away from cholera when he was just a child, and his father&rsquo;s father passed long before he was thought of.&nbsp; When Yashu spoke of his own Grandfather Tadzio felt sick with desire for a grandfather of his own.&nbsp; He had never known a grandfather&rsquo;s love, but still understood that it came through play and mysteries, stories told with a silent meaning that one must discover on his own.&nbsp; Aschenbach, in just these few simple weeks, had provided this and more for Tadzio; he had wanted to ask Aschenbach if he would, out of his heart of hearts, commit to this title for only a few weeks more. <br />

  <br />
The Polish party departed the very next morning.&nbsp; The women of the company were all dressed in white, their hair adorned by crowns of lilies and their breasts bore the emblem of a red heart.&nbsp; Tadzio was buried the following Sunday on a hill in his family grave plot at a local church.&nbsp; The headstone was simple, a slab of white marble with only his name, the dates which he graced his family&rsquo;s lives, and a message:&nbsp; &ldquo;Here lies Love, the beautiful and cherished child&rdquo;.</span></p>

<p align="center" class="style1">2) Eros&rsquo;s Arrow Penetrates Even Through Death<br />By:  Rachel Gardner</p>
<p> Separated from the mainland by the broad expanse of water, separated from his mates by a proud mood, he strode forth, a highly remote and isolated apparition with wind-blown hair, wandering about out there in the sea, in the wind, on the edge of the misty boundlessness.  Once more he stopped to gaze outward.  As Tadzio walks in the water, he looks back and notices a peculiar man sitting in a chair.  Tadzio feels somewhat drawn to this man and begins to wonder why the man is alone.  He notices the man writing intensely on a notebook.  A wave splashes up on Tadzio&rsquo;s feet and his attention goes back to wading in the ocean. <br />
  <br />
  Tadzio begins to feel as if he is being watched, and so he looks back over his shoulder toward the shore.  At that moment Aschenbach&rsquo;s eyes meet Tadzio&rsquo;s gaze.  In that instant Tadzio feels he has some kind of connection with this man.  Tadzio is taken back at first and abruptly turns away to recall whether he has seen the man before.  Tadzio slowly turns back to look at the man once more and to his surprise the man is now slumped over in his chair. <br />
  <br />
  Tadzio begins to walk closer to the man to investigate what has happened.  As he walks closer, Tadzio looks closely at the man&rsquo;s chest which is not moving.  &ldquo;Is this real,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;or only a mirage from the heat?&rdquo;  He quickens his step and looks more intently at the man.  The man&rsquo;s body is not moving.  Tadzio decides to run as fast as he can.  Tadzio feels his heart beating faster and pounding harder in his chest.   As he runs he calls, for someone to come help.  No one is in sight. <br />
  <br />
  Tadzio reaches the man and places his small trembling hand on the man&rsquo;s chest.  The man&rsquo;s skin is wrinkled with age and feels cold.  There is no heart beat.  Tadzio calls out again in a shaky voice, &ldquo;Help someone, HELP!&rdquo;  No one is around.  Tadzio&rsquo;s dawn-green eyes begin to fill with tears.  He had not known the man, but feels compassion and tenderness at his passing. <br />
  <br />
  Tadzio stands by Ashenbach&rsquo;s chair and closes his eyes as the tears run down the perfect contours of his face.  The boy hears the pitter patter of his tears as they fall on the pages of a notebook lying next to the chair on the sand.  The boy opens his eyes and sees the fallen notebook on which the man had been writing.  He softly picks up the book as to protect it for the man. <br />
  <br />
  To Tadzio&rsquo;s relief, he hears the sound of his mother&rsquo;s voice break through the sound of his thumping heart.  Her voice grows louder and more clear as she calls for him.  Tadzio yells back to his mother.  His voice is rocky and weak as he tells her to, &ldquo;Hurry, there is a man who has died!&rdquo;  Tadzio&rsquo;s mother runs as best as she can trudging through the sand to her beloved son.  When she reaches Tadzio, her arms embrace him as she tries to comfort him.  Hand in hand, Tadzio and his mother rush back to the hotel to report the incident to the authorities.  They carry him to his room.  He is one more victim of the cholera epidemic. <br />
  <br />
  Tadzio and his family quickly leave for Poland that day to flee from the epidemic.  While packing, the mother finds the notebook that Tadzio had been holding when she reached him on the beach.  She had put it in her pocket and forgotten it in her haste to return to the hotel.  It would not be till years later before Tadzio&rsquo;s mother would give him 
  the notebook back.  Back in Poland, she reads through the notebook and reads about the love this man had for another boy.  In disgust, she refuses to let her son read it and stores in away in a box.    She only returns it to him when he is older and has returned from the war.<br />
  <br />
  Many years have gone by and World War I is now over.  Poland has regained its independence from Russia.  Tadzio has recently returned to Poland from fighting in the war.  He still lives with his mother in Poland.  After the meal one night Tadzio&rsquo;s mother decides to give him a notebook.  She had come across it in a box in the attic, and felt that it was the right time to give it to her son. <br />
  For Tadzio, it was as if Hermes himself had sent him a great message in the pages of this notebook.  At the sight of the words written there, the memories of the man in Venice floods Tadzio&rsquo;s mind.  When he returns to his bedroom that night, he begins to read the notebook to himself.  As he begins to read about the old man&rsquo;s days in Venice, flashes emerge in Tadzio&rsquo;s imagination of times he recalls seeing the man sometimes at dinner, and often sitting on the beach.  The man always carried this notebook and would write and watch and then write again.  Tadzio reads through the notebook, page after page, discovering that the young boy this man had grown to love was himself as a child.  It was he whom caused this man to stay in Venice even though he would fall victim to the cholera epidemic and die. <br />
  <br />
  Even for a man this was hard for Tadzio to comprehend.  He never knew that someone had such a great passion for him.  Tadzio is taken back by this man&rsquo;s writings, his vivid descriptions and all the comparisons to the gods.  Tadzio will never forget this
man.  Tadzio does not know of anyway better way to express his feelings and honor this man, who considered himself a poet than to become a poet.  Tadzio never had the opportunity to pursue a profession because immediately out of school he was enlisted to fight in the war.  Since Tadzio had been greatly affected by death and the horrors of war, he now wants to pursue life even more.  Tadzio begins to write poems about love and passion, in the man&rsquo;s notebook continuing where the famous Gustav Aschenbach left off.</p>

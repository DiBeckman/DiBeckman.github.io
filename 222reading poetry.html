<p class="red"><strong>The 11 basic steps to reading a poem</strong></p>
<p class="style1">Step 1: Read through the poem to get a sense of it.</p>
<p class="style1">Step 2: Identify the sentences and independent clauses (circle the periods, exclamation points, question marks, and semicolons). For some reason, people always forget that poetry is made up of complete sentences.</p>
<p class="style1">Step 3: Read a few lines to figure out the meter (figure out how many stresses there are in a typical line).</p>
<p class="style1">Step 4: Note the rhyme scheme (look for a pattern).</p>
<p class="style1">Step 5: Read the poem out loud. Try to follow the rhythm. If you do this you'll hear where the poet plays with the rhythm. And you'll hear the rhyme scheme.</p>
<p class="style1">Step 6: Look up any words you don't understand.</p>
<p class="style1">Step 7: Re-read the poem out loud.</p>
<p class="style1">Step 8: Mark off any sections in the poem. These sections may be speeches given by a character, discussions of a particular topic, changes in mood, or a new stage of an argument.</p>
<p class="style1">Step 9: Re-read the poem.</p>
<p class="style1">Step 10: Figure out the tone -- the emotion -- of the poem.</p>
<p class="style1">Step 11: Re-read the poem.</p>
<p class="style1">So far you haven't done any analysis. But you've got a rich understanding of the poem. You know how it works as verse, and you've probably read the poem the way the poet meant it to be read.</p>
<p class="style1"><span class="red"><strong>How To Read a Poem Out Loud</strong></span><br />
</p>
<p class="style1">1) From <a href="http://www.loc.gov/poetry/180/p180-howtoread.html">http://www.loc.gov/poetry/180/p180-howtoread.html</a></p>
<p class="style1">Listen to former Poet Laureate Billy Collins talk about reading a poem.</p>
<p class="style1">No doubt, most of the readers will be students with little or no experience in reading poetry out loud, especially to such a large group. And we know that a poem will live or die depending on how it is read. What follows, then, are a few pointers about the oral recitation of poetry. The readers, by the way, should not read cold; they should be given their poem a few days in advance so they will have time to practice, maybe in the presence of a teacher&hellip; Here are a few basic tips:</p>
<p class="style1">Read the poem slowly. Most adolescents speak rapidly, and a nervous reader will tend to do the same in order to get the reading over with. Reading a poem slowly is the best way to ensure that the poem will be read clearly and understood by its listeners. Learning to read a poem slowly will not just make the poem easier to hear; it will underscore the importance in poetry of each and every word. A poem cannot be read too slowly, and a good way for a reader to set an easy pace is to pause for a few seconds between the title and the poem's first line.</p>
<p class="style1">Read in a normal, relaxed tone of voice. It is not necessary to give any of these poems a dramatic reading as if from a stage. The poems selected are mostly written in a natural, colloquial style and should be read that way. Let the words of the poem do the work. Just speak clearly and slowly.</p>
<p class="style1">Obviously, poems come in lines, but pausing at the end of every line will create a choppy effect and interrupt the flow of the poem's sense. Readers should pause only where there is punctuation, just as you would when reading prose, only more slowly.</p>
<p class="style1">Use a dictionary to look up unfamiliar words and hard-to-pronounce words. To read with conviction, a reader needs to know at least the dictionary sense of every word. In some cases, a reader might want to write out a word phonetically as a reminder of how it should sound. It should be emphasized that learning to read a poem out loud is a way of coming to a full understanding of that poem, perhaps a better way than writing a paper on the subject.</p>
<p class="style1">2. How do you read poetry? Poetry is written to be heard. In the 1800s, it was common for people to get together and read poetry to each other.</p>
<p class="style1">The poem wasn't simply a piece of language that conveyed data; it was meant to be heard the way a song was meant to be sung. <br />
  In order to read poetry well, though, you need to know a little about prosody. Prosody is the theory of rhyme and meter. <br />
  Knowing prosody is to poetry what reading sheet music is to music.</p>
<p class="style1">Poems can be broken down into 3 parts.</p>
<p class="style1"><span class="style3">The Stanza</span>: a group of lines set off from the other lines in a poem. The poetic equivalent of a paragraph. In traditional poems, the stanza usually contains a unit of thought, much like a paragraph.<br />
  <span class="style3">The Line</span>: a single line of poetry.<br />
  <span class="style3">The Foot</span>: a syllable or a group of 2 or 3 syllables. Typically a foot will contain a stressed and an unstressed syllable.<br />
  <br />
  To scan a line of poetry (that means to hear the rhythm) you count the number of feet in a line. For a beginner, the easiest thing to do is to count the number of stresses. This doesn't always work (some feet contain 2 stresses), but it will work often enough to give you the feel of the poem, which is all that we're after at this point.</p>
<p class="style1">In verse (traditional, formal poetry), there will be a regular pattern to the rhythm. Often, all the lines in a poem will contain the same number of feet. For example, in a sonnet, all the lines will have 5 feet. In many cases, though, a poet might alternate between lines with 4 feet and lines with 3 feet. And in other cases, the patterns will be more complex. But unless you are reading free verse, there will be a pattern and you need to identify it.</p>

The checklist also includes the appropriate rubric for your final project.</li></ul>
<p>Read through the topic choices below. Consult Chapter 10 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>, <em>&quot;Writing about Fiction: the World of the Story</em>,&quot; especially the &quot;Getting Ideas&quot; pages (172-78).  Which texts have been your favorite or challenged you the most? Send me an email or make an appointment if you need help deciding on a topic <strong>after</strong> you have finished reading this web page.</p>
<h2>Steps for writing</h2>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Read, re-read and annotate your texts; write preliminary notes; build up to a fully formulated thesis. A thesis is a clear and specific argument, not a list, not an opinion, not an obvious fact.</p>
<p>For help writing a thesis statement, you can work with the Writing and 
    Speaking Tutorial Services. Visit <a href="http://tutorial.dasa.ncsu.edu/writing-speaking/"> their web page</a>  to find out how you can meet with a tutor or consult a web page such as<br />
  <a href="http://www.wisc.edu/writing/Handbook/Thesis.html">http://www.wisc.edu/writing/Handbook/Thesis.html</a><br />

  <a href="http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/thesis-statements/">http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/thesis-statements/</a></p>
<p>We will also do the <a href="222Thesis exercise.html">Thesis exercise</a> in class together.</p>
<p>See the <a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/course/FL/222">Library Tools</a> page to see resources available to you from NCSU Libraries.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Following <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>, Chapter 3; write a first draft of 1-2 pages about one of the topics below for the peer review session. It should have a working title and a fully formulated introduction (you can rewrite them later, but they need to be there for the draft) and several finished paragraphs; your audience knows the text, so you should avoid plot summaries. Use the present tense for literary analysis: Ivan <strong>is</strong> an ambitious&hellip; Flaubert <strong>reveals</strong>&hellip; Include your outline. This is the peer review draft version of your paper; print and bring 2 copies of it to class. Include the <a href="Peerevaluation2.pdf">Peer Review Feedback form</a> with each copy. </p>
<p>Some useful pages (among many) about writing:</p><ul>

<p>Dr. Beckman's hint about titles: A dull title sets expectations low. A good title invites the reader! Quotes, proverbs or aphorisms make great titles. Try a google search with a key word from your thesis (pride, satisfaction, quest, etc) and the word quote. I've already got a <a href="222Lovequotes.html">web page</a> with love quotes for you to use, since love is such a popular topic.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>. Reflect on your peer reviewers' suggestions and write a full draft of your paper to turn in to me. Proofread following the <em>Editing</em> and other checklists listed on the inside cover of <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>. I will not grade the paper at this point but will return it to you with comments, so that you can write the final draft. Consult the <a href="222scoringrubric.html">Scoring Rubric for Papers</a>, <a href="222scoringrubric-rewrite.html">Scoring Rubric for Creative Papers,</a> or <a href="222scoringrubriccreativeart.html">Scoring Rubric for Creative Art Projects</a> so that you'll know what I will be looking for when I do grade the paper.</p>
<p>Chapter 16 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> is an excellent presentation of the style and format I expect in  a literary paper. Pay attention to good organization and logical transitions between paragraphs. Base your arguments on close readings.</p><p>Two areas that are normally weak in the first draft are the use of quotations and the conclusion.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Give concrete examples (quotes) from 
    the texts to support your arguments, but not to fill up space.  These quotations are the evidence you need to provide to prove your thesis. You will usually use at least one in each of body paragraphs.</li>
  <li>In order to integrate quotes appropriately, first introduce the quote by making the point, connected to your thesis, that the passage illustrates. Next, include the quote, usually 3-5 lines of text. Finally, tie the quote back into your argument with a concluding sentence in your own words: &quot;&hellip;remind your reader that these passages are there to prove a point. End your discussion on your words, not theirs.&quot; (Shannon, 162-3).</li>
</ul>
<p>A conclusion is very important to a fully developed paper. Go beyond the ideas in your introduction. Have you proved your thesis? Have you've answered the key question &quot;So what?&quot; in the conclusion to your paper? I will be asking the same question when I read your paper. The conclusion should make the relevance and importance of your research clear.</p>
<p>You are not required to use secondary sources (books, articles, internet) for this paper, but if you do, be sure to quote and document them properly and attach a &#147;Works Cited&#148; page. <strong>Plagiarism is a poor choice and will not be tolerated</strong>; consult the <a href="222CIfa15.html">Course Information</a> page about the NC State academic integrity policy; ask me if questions remain. For information on using research (if you do) and writing the documentation page, consult <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>, chapter 17.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 (final draft)</strong>. Produce the final version: revise, rewrite, amend and polish your draft based on the peer and professor&#146;s review feedback and <span class="text">A Short Guide's</span> checklists and suggestions. Add material if you need more evidence or development of your argument, but also trim unnecessary verbiage. Proofread a final time, out loud, if possible. See <strong>Formatting Requirements</strong> above and the Grading Rubric section on <em>Organization and Format</em>. Is your paper formatted correctly? </p>
<p>Hand in the final 
  version together with all required supporting documents</p><ol><li>a typed first draft </li>
<li><a href="Peerevaluation2.pdf">peer</a> and instructor&#146;s review and 
  evidence that you have addressed these comments</li>
<li><a href="222ChecklistRubric.pdf"> Checklist and Reflective Statement</a>,  <a href="222checklistcreative2013.pdf">Checklist and Reflective Statement for Creative Rewriting Papers</a>, or <a href="self-evaluation-refl-creativeart2013.pdf">Checklist and Reflective Statement for Creative Art Project</a></li>
<li>a final draft reflecting all previous 
  work.</li></ol>
<h2>Paper Topics</h2>
<p><strong>A. Critical creative rewriting</strong></p>
<p>You become the author/artist. Take one of your favorite stories, poems or plays and imagine what happens to the characters after the story ends. You could also rewrite the story before it starts or focus on an important scene from a <em>different</em> character's point of view: Cun&eacute;gonde's, Berthe's or Gerasim's&hellip; One student rewrote Pope's <span class="text">Essay on Man</span> in the format of Baudelaire's &quot;Enivirez-vous.&quot; You could also write a letter from one character to another in the same story or a different story. For example: What advice would Rodolphe give Ashenbach? For a model, see <a href="http://grammar.about.com/od/classicessays/a/franklinmis.htm">Ben Franklin's letter of &quot;Advice on Choosing a Mistress</a>&quot;. Social work and psychology majors have assembled case studies of 5 different characters. Art projects have included paintings of the same scene (&quot;The Lake&quot; by Lamartine) in romantic, realist, and modernist styles and paintings of each of the stanzas of Eliot's &quot;Hollow Men&quot;.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the author's narrative style, plot, characterization, vocabulary and imagery, so that you can imitate it (or even make a parody of it). If you use direct quotes from the original text, put these passages <em>in italics. </em>Include the page reference for your quote. Do not include historical anachronisms, such as a telephone in <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> or snooze button on Gregor's alarm clock.</p>
<p>
There are <strong>two parts</strong> to this project. The first is the <strong>creative</strong> part of the paper, which should be two to three pages long or an artwork, board game, etc.</p>
<p>The second half of the paper will be the <strong>critical </strong>portion: a writing journal or commentary. It should also be a minimum of three pages long for the final version. Explain the stages of your project: first, the choice of story or character, next, the problems and reflections you had while rewriting, including all the ideas you came up with and rejected and the reasons why. Some of the other ideas may lead to other projects later and it is good to have a record of them. Finally, include what you learned about your author and text and the process of writing/ creating? How do you understand the text differently/better than before? For example, what did you notice about your author's style when you read the story for class? What did you notice for the first time during or after class? How did your observation or appreciation of his/her style change as you worked on imitating it? For specifics, be sure to mention the criteria listed <a href="222ImitateStyle.html">here</a>.  The writing journal portion of this paper  is one of the rare occasions in a college paper where it is appropriate to use &quot;I,&quot; as you recount your experience as a writer.  </p>
<p>In other words, your <em>rewrite</em> is your <strong>response</strong> to a text. Your <em>commentary</em> is the <strong>reflection</strong> on that response. For the peer review draft, you should include a page of your rewriting and a page of commentary, perhaps an outline. You will not have a thesis, per se, but you should have a <strong>very clear story idea or premise for alternative art project</strong>. Date entries in your writer's journal. Each time you get new input, such as your peer reviews and your instructor review,  revise your creative section, and add to the journal section to reflect the new issues raised by the reviewers. </p>
<p>You can  read the stories written by students in previous semesters <a href="222CreativeWriting.htm">here</a>. An amazing example which includes the majority of characters studied in FL 222 is <em><a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~dsbeckma/To Hell with Literature.htm">To Hell With Literature</a> </em>(Joey Schopper, Fall 2006).</p>

<p><strong>B. Compare and contrast</strong> at least 2 texts from 2 different authors, including one 
  from the second half of the semester. <span class="red">Use the following comments as a <strong>guide</strong> to develop <strong>your own thesis</strong>. You do not need to answer all of them; you <strong>do</strong> need to have a coherent thesis.  Reminder: an thesis is not a topic, fact or opinion. It is an argument.</span> You may also choose your own topic. (See D below.)</p><ol><li><strong>The Function of Setting in</strong>&#133; (Tolstoy, Woolf, Kafka, Joyce, Brecht, 
  Camus&#133;)
  Discuss how the setting in these texts contributes to the main theme. Include 
  such issues as the history, particular location, spatial relations and the meaning 
  of movement from one space to another, the social meaning of space and place, 
  etc.</li>
<li><strong> Illness, Disease and Death in</strong>&#133; (Flaubert, Tolstoy, Joyce, Mann, 
  Kafka&#133;) Describe how the authors represent illness, disease, and death, 
  and how these themes function in the texts. Pay attention to the societal aspects 
of disease and death. Recommended reading&mdash;two articles  related to what I call <a href="222Isolationandcontact.html">The Gerasim Effect</a>&mdash;<em>The United States holds tens of thousands of inmates in long-term solitary confinement. Is this torture?</em> by Atul Gawande  and <em>Comforter and Comforted in an Unfolding Mystery</em> by Nell Burger Kirst. </li>
<li><strong> The representation of gender roles in</strong>&#133;What positions do men and women occupy in society? What is expected of them because of their gender? What limitations does their gender impose? How does it shape romantic love? What are the differences between married love and romantic love that are portrayed? You may end with a comparison to contemporary gender roles.</li></ol>
<p><strong>C. Text and Film/ Theater</strong>. See a filmed version of one of the texts we have read 
  in class or attend one of the plays performed locally this semester. Films can be viewed online or at DH Hill (see <a href="https://reserves.lib.ncsu.edu/"> reserve</a> holdings for our class). Write an analysis comparing the two&#151;consider how reading 
  and watching film are different. For example, <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span>, &quot;The Dead,&quot; &quot;The Lady with a Dog,&quot; &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest,&quot; and <span class="text">Death in Venice</span> have all been made into films. Your thesis should focus your evaluation of how the filmed version relates to the text version. Is it a successful, weak or failed adaptation? Is it a respectful hommage? A brilliant or flawed reworking of the original? </p>
<p>
  Here are some questions to think about: </p><ul>
<li>What scenes were left out and what scenes were added? How did these changes 
improve or detract from the story? You might want to concentrate on one element 
or even one scene, such as the ending.</li><li>How would you rate the director and the 
choice of cast? Did the actors who played the roles in the film conform to your 
expectations?</li><li>How does the use of language, or the way certain actors behave, 
imply a whole range of characteristics described in words in the book?</li><li>Did the 
director set the right tone for the film?</li><li>How is seeing a play performed different than reading it?</li></ul>
  <p>See &quot;Getting Ideas for Writing about a Film Based on a Work of Literature&quot; (176-78) or &quot;Getting Ideas for Writing about a Film Based on a Play&quot; (216-20) in <span class="text">
A Short Guide</span>.</p>
<p>If you are using a novel that has been remade into film several times, you might 
want to consider the same scene in more than one version and think about time-related 
choices. For instance, <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> has been remade in almost every decade 
  of the 20th century, incuding versions by Jean Renoir in 1933, Vincent Minnelli in 1949, and Claude Chabrol in 1991.  The emphasis in the films is different in part because 
each reflects its own time and the ideas of its director.</p>
<p>See <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> (339) to cite a film or DVD. A useful site to find important quotes from movies: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Search/quotes">http://www.imdb.com/Search/quotes</a>. It is also often useful to listen to the director's commentary, if you are using a DVD with this feature.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> You may also propose <strong>your own topic</strong> as long as it is a <strong>comparison</strong>.  Your proposed topic must be submitted 
  to me for approval by the date of the peer review.</p>

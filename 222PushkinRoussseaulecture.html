<h2>Pushkin, <em>Queen of Spades</em>, Chapters 3 to 6 and Conclusion. </h2>
<p>I am sorry that we had to miss class; I hope that these <em>Notes</em> help to make up for it.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 3</strong><br />
  The epigraph is about love letters which are written faster than they can be read; there something suspicious—either insincere or obsessive—here.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Hermann and Lisaveta exchange letters and arrange to meet in the Countess's house after the ball. Instead Hermann confronts the Countess, after she has undressed, and tries to get her to give him the secret of the three cards. She is silent and mysteriously drops dead.</p>
<p><strong>Key passages:<br />
</strong>810: <em>Hermann quivered like a tiger…dressed only in his frock coat.</em> The tiger is the romantic animal par excellence: powerful and dangerous. Hermann is as keyed up as a predator about to pounce, but strangely oblivious to the howling storm around him. The storm suggests the stormy passions inside Hermann--the pathetic fallacy we'll see again with Lamartine, where the writer attributes human feelings to nature. Lisaveta is easily duped by him; she wants to believe that someone is interested in her.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>811:</strong> <em>Hermann went behind the screen…stepped into the dark study.</em> Like any character on the hero's journey, Hermann comes to a crossroad where he must make a choice. Hermann consciously chooses the Countess over Lisaveta.</p>
<p>While the countess' death is sudden and shocking to both Hermann and the reader, Pushkin actually prepares the reader carefully by dropping clues. in the next to last line on page 811: Three old maid-servants, hastened into the bedroom, followed by the Countess, who tired to <strong>death</strong>, lowered herself… Page 812, paragraph 3: Suddenly, an indescribable change came over her <strong>death-like</strong> face.<br />
  <br />
812: top of the page: Hermann's obsession is already stronger than his sense of compassion or morality.  <em>In his heart there echoed something like the voice of conscience, but it grew silent, and his heart once more turned to stone</em>. </p>
<p>If you were the coroner, what would you put on the death certificate? Did the countess die of fright? Old age? Does it make sense to scare that Hermann threatens her with a gun? If he kills her, he will never learn the secret.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 4</strong><br />
  The epigraph refers to a man without morals or religion: clearly Hermann.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Summary:</strong> Liseveta goes to the ball and is teased by Tomsky about Hermann. Upon returning home, she learns about the Countess's death and Hermann's true motivation. <br />
  <br />
The narrative once again violates conventional chronology by taking us back to the ball, this time with Lisaveta. Tomsky flirts with Lisaveta in order to make the Princess Polina jealous and explicitly paints Hermann as a romantic and cryptically invokes the rule of three. 814: <em>&quot;This Hermann,&quot; Tomsky continued, &quot;is a truly romantic figure: he has the profile of a Napoleon, and the soul of a Mephistopheles. I should think he has at least three crimes on his conscience. </em><br />

  <br />
  Lisaveta's reaction: <em>814 Lisaveta Ivanovna listened to him with horror… It was not she who could satisfy his desire and make him happy!</em> In contrast, Hermann regrets neither abusing her nor killing the countess: 815: <em>He felt no remorse at the thought of the dead lady. He had dismay for only one thing: irretrievable loss of the secret upon which he had relied for enrichment</em>. <br />
  <br />
Once again, the chapter ends at dawn. Lisaveta helps Hermann to escape. Why??</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 5</strong><br />
  The epigraph alludes to a female  ghost.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Summary:</strong> At the countess' funeral, Hermann sees her wink from her coffin.  Lisaveta faints. Later, Hermann is visited by the Countess' ghost who tells him the secret and insists that he marry Lisaveta. <br />
    <br />
    Hermann attends the funeral out of superstion, so he will not be haunted by the countess. 
No one cries. The only people upset are Hermann and Lisaveta. First supernatural element—816: <em>At that very moment it seemed to him that the dead woman gave him a mocking glance, and winked at him. </em>Hermann collapses. Later, after drinking heavily, Hermann believes he is visited by the Countess' ghost, but there are some things that don't seem right to the reader. Pushkin leaves us with several different interpretations, including: 1) Hermann is visited by a ghost. 2) Hermann is
dreaming. 3) Hermann's guilty conscience is overwhelming his sanity. Disturbing clues: someone is looking in the window (816), the ghost makes noise when she walks <em>But he heard unfamiliar footsteps and the soft shuffling of slippers</em> (817); the ghost has been ordered by someone (who??) to come speak to Hermann (817). Why would the Countess want Lisaveta to marry a murderer? Why reward Hermann with the secret? Pushkin chooses to leave the reader perplexed. </p>
<p><strong>Chapter 6</strong><br />
The epigraph: impatience and gambling.<br />
Summary: Hermann goes to Moscow to play the card game and loses on the final card: the Queen of Spades appears before him instead of the ace. <br />
</p>
<p> 817: Hermann's obsession has taken over. (817)<em>&quot;Three, seven, ace&quot; never left his thoughts, were constantly on his lips…an enormous spider.</em><br />
  <br />
Why did Hermann play the wrong card? Did he imagine the secret? Or is it karma: the Countess getting revenge for her death. She becomes the Queen of Spades. 819: At that moment it seemed to him that the queen of spades winked at him and smiled. He was stuck by an unusual likeness. . . . &quot;The old woman!&quot; he shouted in terror.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
Abrupt change in style. Deadpan journalistic reportage. Hermann has gone crazy. Lisaveta has settled for an adequate marriage and is repeating the cycle with her own poor relation. Strangely, the story ends with the success of Tomsky who has succeed, unlike Hermann, in getting what he wants, in this case, the hand of the Princess Polina. Why end the story this way?</p>
<h2>Jean-Jacques Rousseau</h2>
<p><br />
  <img alt="File:Jean-Jacques Rousseau (painted portrait).jpg" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau_%28painted_portrait%29.jpg/430px-Jean-Jacques_Rousseau_%28painted_portrait%29.jpg" height="375" width="294" />  <br />
  <br />
Looking at his dates (1712-1778) and his wig, it is apparent that he died before Romanticism officially begins.(In fact, he dies the same year as Voltaire.) Rousseau  is considered the bridge between the Enlightenment and Romanticism. He made significant and progressive contributions to fields from anthropology to political theory, education, and literature. Most notably for this class, he stresses the idea of the noble savage: the idea that human beings are naturally good and it is society that corrupts us.<br />
<em>‹‹L'homme est né libre, et partout il est dans les fers.››</em> &quot;Man is/was born free but everywhere he is in chains.&quot;<em> (Du Contrat social</em>, 1762 )</p>
<p>He writes a new kind of autobiography in the exonerative mode: he wants to justify his own behavior, and in brilliantly romantic fashion, trumpet his individualism. He also illustrates the importance of feelings and childhood events determine adult preferences and beliefs. Do not overlook the importance of the word <strong>nature</strong> in Rousseau's writing<br />
</p>
<p>Some of the most important <strong>binary oppositions</strong> in the first book of the <em>Confessions</em>:<br />
  <br />
right/wrong; truth/lie<br />
wicked/kind; young/old<br />
praise/disgrace chaste/depraved<br />
punishment/pleasure<br />
vigorous/weak<br />
justice/injustice</p>
<p>  <strong>Key passages</strong>: Line 2 498: <em>&quot;My purpose is display to my kind a portrait in every way true to nature…I may be no better, but at least I am different.</em> <em>Whether <strong>Nature</strong> did well or ill in breaking the mold in which she formed me, is a question which can only be resolved after the reading of my book.&quot;</em><br />
  <br />
  In a characteristically (and excessively?) frank passage, Rousseau attributes his adult sexual preferences 
to the beatings he received from Mademoiselle Lambercier, his beloved guardian and mother figure. 502: <em>Who could have supposed that this childish punishment…</em><br />
<br />
He also explains his life-long commitment to 
fighting injustice when he recounts the story of refusing to admit that he has broken a comb. 505: &quot;<em>I feel my pulse beat faster once more as I write. I shall always remember that time if I live to be a thousand. That first meeting with violence and injustice… Thus ended the serenity of my childish life.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Emile</strong><br />
  As part of his novel about the perfect education for a child, Rousseau shares his ideas about educating both boys and girls. While his ideas about women are radically politically incorrect for our time, 
Rousseau did contribute to what is now called &quot;developmentally-appropriate&quot; childhood education. He  stresses the importance of teaching children through the way they like best to learn: play. As always, the best teacher is nature: </p>
<p><strong>Key passages and binary oppositions:</strong><br />
  <br />
men/women<br />
superior/inferior<br />
tomb/throne<br />
suffering/pleasure<br />
boredom/pleasure<br />
occupation/amusement<br />
<br />
  If you want right guidance, always follow the leadings of <strong>nature</strong>. (256)<br />
  By the very <strong>law of nature</strong> women are at the mercy of men's judgments both for themselves and for their children. (257)<br />
  Everything that checks and constrains <strong>nature</strong> is in bad taste. (258) </p>

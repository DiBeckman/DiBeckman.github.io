<p class="style2"><span class="style3"><a href="08 - Cancer.mp3">Cancer</a><br />
</span>Deception in politics is cancer - Thinking that you got all the answers is cancer<br />
  Willful ignorance thats cancer - Ten year olds making fly kicks in them sweatshops cancer<br />
  Fifteen hours a day with hardly no pay, did i mention - disgusting working conditions thats cancer<br />
Psychological manipulation - appealing to the senses through reality tv dramatization </p>
<p class="style3">The socio-political construction of race thats cancer - designed to hoard wealth, while everybody else self-destructs<br />
  Plus - people thinking that they &quot;black&quot; when they could be Oulof - I swear thats wack<br />
  It's easy to see, if you strip a person of their identity, they implode mentality - its cancer<br />
  Stratification and inequality caused by capitalism and greed cancer</p>
<p class="style3">Lights, camera, action - media controlled by elite factions - cancer<br />
  Portraying images of minorities as criminals cancer - determining what's proper and good<br />
  They say if you &quot;hood&quot;, or look anything like you &quot;hood&quot; then you cancer - cancer<br />
  Denying a man a job and meat to eat 'cause of the way that he speaks thats weak and it's cancer</p>
<p class="style3">All religions from catholicism to christianity to islam cancer<br />
  Through tradition, people are regulated by what God never mandated and its cancer<br />
  The Creator wants companionship with mankind - ferocity, cancer - hypocrisy, cancer<br />
  Lack of sympathy and love for the next man that be cancer - its killing us, cancer - its killing us cancer</p>
<p class="style3">Bias in standardized tests, that be cancer - teachers treating little kids like animals <br />
  Because they don't reflect middle class values - and they might be a little dirty<br />
  But that doesn't make 'em unworthy of getting the same education as rich little Ernie<br />
  You got the rich kids picking on the poor - the poor lashing back like &quot;take my wrath&quot; its cancer</p>
<p class="style3">Indifference to, or attacking YHWH's perfect sacrifice thats cancer<br />
  Commercial hip-hop and its cliches - get the guap, get the cheese, copp the drop, cock the glock<br />
  Now squeeze - Where the freaks? Make em hot, watch em drop, to they knees, slob a cock<br />
  Then its two fingers peace - I swear these record labels got dudes on their knees, and its killing music <br />
  Its all cancer</p>
<p class="style2"><a href="09 - Candid Parlance.mp3">Candid Parlance</a><br />
  Fresh out the booth - feeling like a new man<br />
  Promoting myself like Jackie Moon fams <br />
  Catch me on campus - how you do ma'am?<br />
  Gurls hot like they just got two tans <br />
  Are you swell, mademoiselle? - You got my heart screaming something like Patti Labelle<br />
  I just went blind, would you be my brail?  Nah, I'm just kidding<br />
  Here's my website, check me - let me know if you're diggin<br />
  The lyrics and production - my heart and soul over horns and percussion <br />
  Hit me up, let's have some discussion <br />
  About real issues - It amazes me how life can be a maze you see?<br />
  I'm trynna get it in with the people - I aint got time to float around like your boi is so super regal <br />
  I'm tired of hearing 'bout being &quot;fly&quot;, fabricated lies, pontificated by these guys<br />
  Claiming that their thrones' in the skies - Little kids like costumes - these dudes in disguise<br />
  I must have missed dress-rehearsal - Nowadays people look a little TOO commercial <br />
Come walk with a gentleman, I'll show you just how gentle I am</p>
<p class="style3"><span class="style4"><a href="10 - Marinate (singing version).mp3">Marinate<br />
</a></span>I grab my pen and my paper, transcend to another place - i'll see you later<br />
  I'm meditating on historic events, I'm meditating on them ancient scripts<br />
  Levitating like an angel but my name aint Chris, on my shoulder is no dandruff but a couple of chips<br />
  Chardonnay in my glass - i take a couple of sips<br />
  Instrumental on blast, snares a couple of kicks -- they so sick<br />
  I just wanna chill with no drama - where's Maury Povich - or Ricky Lake<br />
  I need a break for my mental sake, see me take, a couple of hours and just marinate<br />
  Separate myself from people who be actin' fake<br />
  Me and solitude have a date- and she told me do not be late<br />
I'm showing up with flowers, chill mode activate</p>
<p class="style3">Can I live, Can I breathe <br />
  A little bit of solitude is all I need<br />
  Couple deep breaths and i'm at it again<br />
  My only true friends are my pad and my pen</p>
<p class="style3">It just so happens, i'm close to my pad and pen like Sam - and Frodo Baggins<br />
  See us relaxin and laughin - basking together, companions no matter the weather <br />
  I swear it's all passion when I'm passin my soul to my pad - I'm Steve Nashin<br />
  Deep incisions with my pen, creating artful curves<br />
  Transplant surgery as i place my heart in words, a lot more than nouns and verbs <br />
  I know it sounds absurd, but I would rather chill with you<br />
  Than clowns who be following the herd, who swallowing media's turds<br />
  Wallowing in ignorance, its sickenin and I'm sick of it - it's ridiculous and some know it<br />
  Others are the systems victims<br />
  That's the reason why my lyrics is meticulous I'm staying true and never fictitious<br />
  <br />
  Repeat Chorus<br />
  <br />
  (Ahhhh) Do you hear that?  That's the sound of relief<br />
  As I dwell by myself far away from fake peeps<br />
  Around you they act one way - others come around it's another OK<br />
  I aint got time for this babe, I gotta burn rubber <br />
  Pedal to the metal - I gotta bury this, where's my shovel?  It's my biz<br />
  To tell it like it is - I'm on my Aaron Neville<br />
  Seeking others on my level - Mentality so rebel as I revel at the thought of revolution<br />
  That won't be sparked by any man - Give me spins, I'll change the climate like a ceiling fan<br />
  True company - No chance of silly friends<br />
  It's depressing times, but pressing I'm trynna stay giddy like Hello Kitty fans<br />
  And lyrics stayin' blazin' cajun like a box of Zatarains</p>

<h2>Flaubert Lecture 5; Passages to <span class="red">read</span> and comments.</h2>
<p>(I've included some passages that we wouldn't have had time to get to in class, but if I had more time, I would love to include.)<br />
</p>
<p class="class"><strong>Chapter i: Léon and Emma reunited. Cathedral and carriage</strong>.</p>
<p> 1180: <span class="red">That night Emma wrote the clerk an <em>endless</em> letter cancelling their appointment… she hadn't Léon's address.</span><br />
  <em class="red">endless</em> Flaubert's irony about Emma's posturing, another important letter in the novel.<br />
  <br />
  Irony of Léon's choice of meeting site, the Rouen Cathedral (Compare with Monet's impressionist <a href="http://learn.columbia.edu/monet/swf/">series</a>) <br />
  <br />
  1180-1: <span class="red">It was a fine summer morning…resolutely entered the church. </span>Léon buys the bouquet of violets; is the gesture for her or him? </p>
<p>1181: <span class="red">Léon walked meditatively…The church was like a giant boudoir, suffused by her image…clouds of perfume.</span><br />
  Léon confuses the church with Emma's bedroom. (blasphemy)
  <br />
  A Boudoir: boudoir |ˈbo͞oˌdwär| noun chiefly historical or humorous a woman's bedroom or private room.<br />
ORIGIN late 18th cent.: French, literally <strong><em>&lsquo;sulking place.&rsquo;</em></strong> (New Oxford American Dictionary, 2nd Edition © Copyright 2005-2007 Apple Inc.)</p>
<p> 1182-3: &quot;Comic interplay between the verger (boiling with anger at seeing a potential sightseer taking the liberty of admiring the church by itself) and Léon who does not want to see sights. Emma clings with her expiring virtue to the Virgin… exasperating Leon. The torrent of the verger's description runs parallel to the impatient storm in Léon's mood. The verger is about to show them, of all phallic symbols, the 440 foot steeple when Léon rushes Emma out of the church and into a cab.&quot; (<em>Norton Critical Edition</em> of <em>Madame Bovary</em>)</p>
<p>What makes her decide to give into him.?<br />
  1183: <span class="red">&quot;What's improper about it?&quot; retorted the clerk. &quot;Everybody does it in Paris.&quot;<br />
It was an irresistible and clinching argument.</span></p>
<p> Once again, it's the irresistible argument of Paris that convinces her. The description of <span class="red">the flames of hell</span> (1184) foreshadows Emma's fall. <br />
  <br />
  1184-5: <span class="red">Where does Monsieur wish to go? …without a backward glance</span>. A fascinating narrative strategy! We are outside the carriage for the rest of the scene, just like one of the citizens of Rouen. What's unusual about this cab ride? The driver can't understand why they won't stop. This entire passage was suppressed in the magazine where Madame Bovary was first published. Don't forget Flaubert was taken to court for obscenity and blasphemy--even though we can't see what's happening inside the cab.</p>
<p>1185:<span class="red">…</span> <span class="red">a bare hand appeared…threw out some torn scraps of paper. The wind scattered them, and they alighted at a distance like white butterflies…</span></p>
<p><span class="red"><em>torn scraps</em>:</span> Emma's (insincere) undelivered letter renouncing her meeting with Léon. <br />
<span class="red"><em>butterflies</em></span>: echoing the <span class="red">black butterflies</span> that flew up the chimney when Emma burns her wedding bouquet (page 1077). <br />
<span class="red"><em>her veil down</em></span>: recurring  image of the female condition throughout the novel: 1089: <span class="red">…her will like the veil tied to her hat quivers with every breeze…</span> 1200: <span class="red">From that moment on, she piled lie upon lie, using them as  veils to conceal her love.</span> (See Manet's <a href="http://www.lifeasmyth.com/journal_other_morisotmanet.html">portraits</a> of Berthe Morisot. Tarbell's <a href="http://www.wikigallery.org/wiki/painting_246671/Edmund-Charles-Tarbell/page-1"><em>The Blue Veil</em></a><em></em>. This would make a great term paper project.) <br />
<span class="red"><em>without a backward glance</em></span>: Knowing it is wrong (<span class="red">the veil</span>), Emma has no regrets about starting a new affair, this time with Léon.</p>
<p><strong><span class="class">Chapter ii</span></strong><br />
  Emma returns home after her adventure, misses the coach.<br />
1185: <span class="red">&quot;Madame you must go straight to Monsieur Homais' It's something urgent.&quot; </span>She tries to get the information from Homais but although he's rehearsed the announcement, he's caught up making jelly and giving a tongue-lashing to Justin: why? <br />
<br />
1187: <span class="red">&quot;But you had something to   tell me? said Emma…frightful gastric pains. </span>Homais' news is supposed to be about Charles' father's death, but the real message is the information given to Emma which she will later use  to get the arsenic when she decides to kill herself. The <span class="red">gastric pains</span> are a foreshadowing of her own painful death.</p>
<p>1189: Hippolyte carrying her bags is a reminder of the botched surgery, for which she blames Charles, not herself. Does she show any sympathy for Charles in his grief? No, she lies to him about the violets Léon gave her.  Lheureux takes advantage of the couple's grief to get Emma to take over the family finances. She in turn uses it as excuse to spend three days in Rouen with Léon. <br />
  <br />
  <span class="class"><strong>Chapter iii-iv</strong></span><br />
  At first the affair goes beautifully, worthy of the most French famous romantic poem. 1192: old translation of <em>The Lake,</em>  reappearance of Rodolphe as <span class="red">a big good-looking fellow with a little moustache. </span>1193:  Mme Rollet comes every day at lunch because she is now serving as the go-between for Emma and Léon: love letters are a must and recurring motif in the novel. Emma decides to become musical… &quot;But gradually, like old pieces of scenery, her life begins to shake and fall apart. Beginning with chapter 4, fate, as controlled by Flaubert, proceeds to destroy her with beautiful precision. Léon and Lheuereux are two extremities of the candle that Emma is burning at both ends.&quot; <em>(Norton Critical Edition</em> of <em>Madame Bovary</em>). Compare with Edna St. Vincent Millay's 1920 poem: <span class="egsf">My candle burns at both ends; it will not last the night; but ah, my foes, and oh, my friends - it gives a lovely light!</span></p>
<p><span class="class"><strong>Chapter v</strong></span><br />
1198: <span class="red">On this hill,…and the leaves on the trees. </span><br />
This is the
first time we see the beggar. It's always a daring narrative strategy for an author to introduce a new character this late in the story. The beggar is important on several levels. First of all the gruesome description reinforces Flaubert's realist style with special emphasis on physical and medical details. As a sociologist, the beggar's disgusting condition reflects badly on the lack of social support for the poor and disfigured. As a novelist, the beggar is an inverted mirror image of Emma, his hideous exterior representing her inner moral corruption. His lack of sight may also represent her lack of insight into her own behavior and situation. Clearly, his song refers to her dreaminess and extramarital affairs (<span class="red">A lass to stray in dreams of love</span>) for his song sounds a lot like romantic poetry.</p>
<p>1198: <span class="red">His voice, at the outset a mere wail, would grow shrill…mud with a shriek</span>.  Was this the sound we heard when Emma first gave herself to Rodolphe? (We've had so many possibilities, again no accident for an artist like Flaubert). The beggar's song and shrieks accompany Emma on her trips between Rouen and Yonville.</p>
<p>1200: <span class="red">From that moment on, she piled lie upon lie, using them as  veils to conceal her love.</span> <span class="red">Lying became a need, a mania, a positive joy—to such a point that if she said that she had walked down the right-hand side of a street the day before, it meant that she had just gone down the left.</span> <br />
  1) 
Charles catches her in the lie about the piano lessons, but she easily fools him by creating a fake receipt. See <span class="red">veil</span> imagery above. We also see Emma's development from a cheat into a compulsive liar. </p>
<p>1201 Lheureux gets her to sign more notes and 1202-3 Madame Bovary the elder sees though her tricks (<span class="red">prophesying that they'd end up in the poor house</span>). For once, Charles stands up to his mother and throws her out.<br />
1204-5 : Gender role reversal again with Léon: <span class="red">He never disputed any of her idea; he fell in with all her tastes: he was becoming her mistress, far more than she was his…</span> <span class="red">Her depravity was so deep and so dissembled as to be almost intangible: where could she have learned it?</span> This is a question Flaubert never answers! He's written a disturbing and successful psychological case study in novel form.</p>
<p><strong><span class="class">Chapter vi</span></strong><br />
Homais comes to Rouen and traps Léon who is late for his meeting with Emma. It's the first big fight between them. <br />
1207: <span class="red">She had just left him in a fury…He was unheroic, weak, commonplace, spineless as a woman, and stingy and timorous to boot.…But casting aspersions on those we love always does something to loosen our ties. We shouldn't maltreat our idols; the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilding">gilt</a> comes off in our hands… She pulled so savagely at her corset string that it hissed around her hips like a gliding snake</span>. Gender role reveraal again: in her anger, Emma compares Léon to a woman. Be sure to read the final line aloud. Why is this such a great simile? Even in translation we hear the <span class="lecture">s</span>ibilant <span class="fuchsia">s</span>'s that echo the image of the <span class="fuchsia">s</span>nake: an allusion to <span class="fuchsia">s</span>in and <span class="fuchsia"><a href="http://www.dailyyonder.com/files/imagecache/story_default/imagefield/michaelangelo%20adam%20and%20eve530.jpg">S</a></span><a href="http://www.dailyyonder.com/files/imagecache/story_default/imagefield/michaelangelo%20adam%20and%20eve530.jpg">atan in the Garden of Eden</a>. </p>
<p>1208: Emma's fatal discontent. <span class="red">No matter, she wasn't happy, and never had been. Why was life so unsatisfactory? Why did everything she leaned on crumble instantly to dust? But why, if somewhere there existed a strong and handsome being…</span> Could any human being meet her needs? (see 1213 below)<br />
  <br />
Meanwhile the financial noose around her neck tightens. Emma starts selling her own clothes, but always ends up borrowing more money. She goes through yet another manic shopping phase. </p>
<p>1211: <span class="red">The house was a gloomy place these days… she wasn't to blame.</span> The holes in Berthe's stockings are a symbol  oft her growing poverty and neglect of Berthe: Félicité takes over her role as mother; she's always done a better job than Emma. Emma asks Léon to pawn her wedding spoons. He gets a warning speech from his employer, Maître Bocage (Mr. Wooded Countryside). </p>
<p>Disillusion with Léon sets in. Although Flaubert was accused in court of glorifying adultery, if I were his lawyer, I would point to this passage as well as Emma's fate. <br />
  1212:
  <span class="red">Adultery, Emma was discovering, could be as banal as marriage.</span><br />
<br />
  1213: 
  Emma dreams of a phantom lover: <span class="red">Still she continued to write [Leon] loving letters, faithful to the idea that a woman must always write her lover. But as her pen flew over the paper she was aware of the presence of another man, a phantom embodying her most ardent memories, the most beautiful things she had read and her strongest desires. In the end he became so real and accessible that she tingled with excitement, unable though she was to picture him clearly, so hidden was he, godlike, under his manifold attributes. He dwelt in that enchanted realm where silken ladders swing form balconies moon-bright and flower-scented. She felt him near her: he was coming-- to ravish her entirely in a kiss. And the next moment she would drop back to earth, shattered; for these rapturous love-dreams drained her more than the greatest orgies. </span>[I had this already typed up.]</p>
<p>1213:Emma's perfect escape fantasy:  <span class="red">She loathed everything, including herself. She longed to fly away like a bird, to recapture her youth somewhere far away in the immaculate reaches of space.</span></p>
<p>Finally comes the confrontation between Emma and Lheureux 1215: <span class="red">&quot;I implore you, Monsieur Lheureux—just a few days more&quot;…&quot;A lot I care! he said, closing the door behind her.&quot;</span><br />
  <br />
  <strong><span class="class">Chapter vii </span></strong><br />
This chapter marks the opposite of awards at the Agricultural Fair which was the high point of rural prosperity. This is the low point. It also reveals how the secondary capitalists (money-lenders, lawyers, bankers and tax collectors)  are the ones who destroy Emma, with her help. Charles still has no idea what's going on. The <em>huissier/</em>bailiff comes to do the inventory for the auction since she cannot pay her debt. She needs 8000 francs. The inventory is compared to an autopsy; the household disintegrates before our eyes. 1215: <span class="red">They inspected her dresses, the linens…like a dissected corpse</span>. The simile is appropriate to Charles and his lack of success as a surgeon. Emma gets indignant as the bailiff whose <span class="red">great red hand with its soft sluglike fingers</span> (1216; awesomely repulsive image)  inspects everything including Rodolphe's love letters. (Old love letters are a haunting, recurring motif.)<br />
<br />
  Who does she turn to in order to try to get the money?<br />
  <br />
  1) local bankers who laugh in her face<br />
  2) Léon 1216-7. Does he help?<br />
  <br />
  She walks by the Cathedral on the way to catch the coach home and thinks  she sees the Vicomte. As we saw with Hermann in <em>The Queen of Spades</em>, mental stability shakes and shudders before it fails. <br />
  1217: <span class="red">&quot;Watch out!…good old Mr. Homais.</span><br />
You know something is wrong if someone is actually glad to see Homais! The <span class="red">abyss</span> in the passage represents her mental descent. On the carriage ride home, she and Homais have another encounter with the blind man which reveals both their characters.</p>
<p>1218: <span class="red">The blind man…juniper berries!&quot;</span> The blind man is compared to <span class="red">a famished dog</span>, which is how he is treated by society. Emma throws him her last five francs, thinking herself generous. We note the irony considering how deep in debt she is! Homais shouts his typical useless and pompous advice, as if the beggar has a choice about  what to eat and wear.<br />
  <br />
  3) On Felicité's advice Emma goes to see the notary, Guillaumin, whose house was actually one of the very first things we saw in Yonville, where it was described as <span class="red">the finest in town</span> (1078). She is greeted by the butler Théodore who, as the love interest of Félécité,   knows the whole story. In fact, Guillaumin is the arch-spider pulling  the strings in the financial web in which Emma is ensnared. Lheureux reports to him. To understand Emma, you have to see the notary's house through her eyes—here she is, her household goods up for auction, and what does she think? 1220: <span class="red">&quot;This,&quot; thought Emma, &quot;is the kind of dining room I should have.&quot; </span>[My favorite line in the novel along with <span class="red">She longed to travel…She wanted to die. And she wanted to live in Paris. 1072.</span>] </p>
<p>Guillaumin wants sexual favors in exchange for his financial help. Emma's ironically comic reaction 1221:<span class="red"> It's shameless of you to take advantage of my distress! I'm to be pitied, but I'm not for sale!&quot;</span> Flaubert wants us to ask if that is true. He continues relentlessly to expose her psychological weaknesses. For example, she will do anything, including killing herself to avoid the look of forgiveness on Charles' face. 1222: <span class="red">&quot;Don't stay here…the man I wouldn't forgive for setting eyes on me if he offered me a million…Never! Never!</span><br />
  <br />
4) Next prospect: Binet. Emma sneaks out of the house to avoid a confrontation with Charles. Flaubert's narrative subtlety: the scene with Binet is witnessed from the outside by the neighborhood snoops: Tuvache and Caron. 1223 <span class="red">&quot;Is she making advances to him?…as if he had seen a snake.</span> Once again, Emma is connected with the serpent.</p>
<p>• Emma goes to Madame Rollet, waiting for Leon who doesn't come. She thinks she still hears Binet's lathe turning; we can think of it as the  wheel of fortune (remember <em>Candide</em>?) now at its lowest spot. She gets the idea of going to Rodolphe which inspires Flaubert to makes the irony of her refusal of Guillaumin explicit.<br />
  1224:
    <span class="red">So she set out for La Huchette…totally unconscious that she was prostituting herself.</span><br />
</p>
<p><span class="class"><strong>Chapter viii</strong></span><br />
Does Rodolphe help? Why not? Does the reader believe him when he says he doesn't have the money?<br />
Three astounding
paragraphs on page 1227:<span class="red"> She stood there in a daze…came to the pharmacy.</span><br />
<br />
The cinematic quality of the imagery is impressive since we are still 20 years away from the invention of the cinema. Emma conveniently forgets that her problems are due to her overspending and foolish loans  and thinks only how disappointing love is. The crows are a chilling foreshadowing of death. (Compare to Van Gogh's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheatfield_with_Crows"><em>Wheatfield with Crows</em></a><em></em>.) Military imagery dominates, and Emma sees herself as a soldier (<span class="red">life flowing out with his blood through the gaping hole</span>). Then we see a transformation as Emma plans ahead for the first time: two words that we have never seen in connection with her before: <span class="red">with a <em>heroic</em> resolved that made her almost <em>happy</em></span>.</p>
<p>She gets the arsenic from Justin recalling the scene in <span class="class">Chapter ii</span>. She  eats it <span class="red">greedily</span> in front of Justin and takes a page from Lheureux's book by threatening him with blackmail. The final line before the chapter break is powerful: <span class="red">almost as <em>serene</em> as though she had done her <em>duty</em></span>. This is the first time we've seen her at peace. </p>
<p>Back home, she still hasn't confessed to Charles. Instead of telling him, she sits down and writes her last letter, a suicide note. She thinks she's going to have a very peaceful death, but no…<br />
  <br />
1229:<span class="red"> She began to moan…Speak to me! What did you eat? Answer for heaven's sake!&quot; And in his eyes she read a love such as she had never known</span>.<br />
Flaubert cares so much about realism that he actually tasted arsenic so that he could authentically describe Emma's experience here. The symptoms here and in the pages that follow are all medically accurate. The final line of the passage is one that is key to your interpretation of the story. Emma has been searching for complete, unconditional love throughout the story and she finally sees it. If she weren't to die, how might this change their relationship? But, no, it is too late. We'll never find out. The major and minor characters reappear for this crucial death scene but I will focus on two key passages. 
</p>
<p>The first is one of the passages at issue when Flaubert and his publisher were taken to trial accused of immorality and blasphemy. Flaubert responded that he took the details of the final rites directly from church literature. This is Bournisien's finest hour:</p>
<p>1234: <span class="red">The priest stood up and took the crucifix. the most passionate love-kiss she had every given…never to walk again.</span> Flaubert has been preparing us for this scene since <span class="class">Chapter vi of Part I</span> about Emma's  education. Most remarkable is the way that Flaubert has the priest combine the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins">7 deadly sins</a> with the 5 senses.</p>
<p>The final passages of the chapter are given over to the blind man. Is he really there or is Emma imagining him. The tapping cane reminds us of Hippolyte's leg. For Emma, the blind man is Death himself, the Grim Reaper: <span class="red">a figure of terror</span> <span class="red">looming up in the darkness of eternity (1235). </span>How do you interpret Emma's laugh? For some critics, it's a sign of her insanity, for others, her final insight.</p>
<p>What could be less romantic than the final paragraph of the chapter? <span class="red">A spasm flung her down on the mattress. Everyone drew close. She had ceased to exist.</span><br />
</p>
<p><span class="class"><strong>Chapter ix</strong></span></p>
<p> The story is not over with Emma's death. Flaubert, ever the realist, wants to show us the impact that this woman continues to have on the people around her. He provides the details of the burial and shows how different characters have their roles to play. </p>
<p>1235 Homais  writes two letters and finds a lie to deflect responsibility for Emma's death; he and Emma are matched pair of liars.<br />
  1236: Charles locks himself  his consulting room. <span class="red">&quot;I want her buried…I detest your God!&quot; </span>Charles' grief is profound. He wants Emma to have  layers of coffins Napoleon's, but also like the hat, the wedding cake, the layers of lies earlier in the novel. The Priest and Homais have become a matched pair like bookends. They protest but Charles ignores them as well as his mother.</p>
<p><strong class="class">Chapter x </strong><br />
  The funeral recalls the  wedding scene in <span class="class">Chapter iv, Book I</span>. The music and priest's voice echo the violin at wedding, but the tap, tap, tap of Hippolyte's fancy leg, a guilt gift from Emma tells us how much has changed. Flaubert brings all the characters together as a sort of farewell to Emma. Charles' mother seems to be happy thinking  she'll get Charles back. Emma's father arrives too late. Rodolphe and Léon are unperturbed. The only one at the funeral other than Charles who grieves is Justin, as we learn at the end of the chapter. Yet his fate is unhappy. Sympathy is not rewarded in this novel. </p>
<p><span class="class"><strong>Chapter xi</strong></span><br />
People come to claim debts, legitimate and illegitimate. Félécité runs off with Théodore and Emma's clothes (becoming Emma?). Léon marries. Emma's destruction of Charles continues. Although Flaubert gave us no illusion about the immortal soul when Emma died, we see that some evils do transcend death. <br />
1245: <span class="red">To please her…She was corrupting him from beyond the grave.</span></p>
<p>The end: 1247-1249. <br />
  The downward fall of Charles is matched by the rise of Homais who gets the blind beggar committed and whose family thrives as Charles' disintegrates. Justin runs off to Rouen. Homais won't let his children associate with Berthe. The Priest goes off the deep end. <br />
  1248  Letters again. Charles learns the truth about his wife: <span class="red">Out of respect…walking and weeping aloud. </span>Charles goes to town to sell his last asset, a horse, bringing that leitmotif (a recurrent theme throughout a musical or literary composition, associated with a particular person, idea, or situation; Google.com) full circle. There he meets Rodolphe and just as Emma predicted, manages to show his power of forgiveness. Ironically, Charles uses the word <span class="red">fate</span> as he absolves Rodolphe, since that is the very word that Rodolphe used in his breakup letter to Emma (1158).</p>
<p>1249: <span class="red">&quot;No one is to blame. It was decreed by fate.&quot; </span></p>
<p>The following day Charles galls asleep and dies on the bench where Emma used to meet her lovers. Berthe finds him. Monsieur Canivet <span class="red">performed an autopsy, but found nothing.</span> Perhaps like Charles' first wife, he died of shock and a broken heart. Then, like the end of <span class="text">The Queen of Spades</span>, Flaubert offers us a final disposition off all the characters.</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution claims Berthe—she goes to work in the cotton mill, a grim life so different than the one her mother had or her father dreamed for her. The final sentence about Homais offers us the final irony of the novel. <span class="red">He has just been awarded the cross</span> <span class="red">of the Legion of Honor</span>. This is the highest award in the French government. The irony is bitter. Homais is the least-deserving character in the novel : as deceitful as Emma, timid as Léon, and selfish as Rodolphe. He has no sense of beauty or truth. Homais' award marks the triumph of all his hypocrisy and self-promotion. How far we've come from the excitement in the Enlightenmen when daily newpapers were invented to spread new ideas. Homais uses them to spreading self-promoting lies. He is so different from Emma, yet so similar.</p>
<p>Why is this book important:<br />
Literature will never be the same. By his artistic power, Flaubert manages to transform a dreadful world inhabited by frauds and brutes and wayward ladies into one of the most perfect pieces of poetical fiction, and  he achieves this by bringing all the parts into harmony, using such devices as counterpoint of transition from one theme to other, of foreshadowing and echoes.</p>
<p>It sets the stage for the way novels are supposed to be constructed, with realistic description, the importance of observation, and psychological believability of characters. Emma becomes an archetype, a symbol of the human desire to dream, to wish for inaccessible and unrealizable happiness, connected to the dreams fostered by novels in Emma's time and movies and TV in ours. </p>
<p>This novel is about Emma AND her environment: the two main characters in the book.</p>
<p>My favorite question from an earlier semester: Who do you feel more sympathy for? Charles or Emma?<br />
  <br />
Finally, see this quote from the <em>Norton Critical Edition of Madame Bovary: </em>The very day after the book appeared, people demanded to know the identity of    Madame Bovary. When Flaubert feeling persecuted, answered with a statement that    was in effect the simple truth—&ldquo;I am Madame Bovary!&rdquo; everyone    assumed he was joking. Yet could anything be more true, more certain?&quot; <br />
</p>
<p> As Cookie Ngyyuen wrote in Fall 2005, &quot;The world created Emma because the world is Emma.&quot; How many of us can deny that we have a little Emma Bovary inside us, too? </p>
<p>Quotes are from The Norton Anthology's translation of <em>Madame Bovary</em>, and <em>The Norton Critical Edition of Madame Bovary (</em>first edition, 1965).</p>

<p align="center" class="style4">1)<em> Love Me, Respect Me, as I Love You</em><br>
by Aricia Cox</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People were staring and whispering as I walked across the promenade-dog in hand.&nbsp; There he was, gray haired and strangely handsome; his eyes were fixed upon me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was he trying to show me his interest in me? Is he trying to figure out who I am and what I am doing here all by myself?&rdquo; I wondered what was running through his mind.&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t sure, so I continued my walk lowering Lady so she could exercise her legs.&nbsp; I had been in Yalta, by myself, for 5 days awaiting a message from my husband.&nbsp; Besides Lady, I had no one to keep me company.&nbsp; Maybe I will meet a friend in the next few days to keep me company while I wait for my husband.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few evenings later I went to dine in the park with Lady.&nbsp; There he was.&nbsp; In his black suit, hat, and mustache, he was sitting at a table alone watching the scenery.&nbsp; Trying not to make eye contact with him, I made my way over to a table near him.&nbsp; As I sat down at the table, I watched him follow me all the way into my chair with his eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is he going to be the friend I can pass the time with while I am away from my love? Maybe Lady will attract him and we can finally meet,&rdquo; I wondered.&nbsp; Lady scurried across to his feet as soon as I let her down.&nbsp; Looking up at the intriguing man, he asked if he could feed her a bone; I gave him my permission with a nod, pretending to be shy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>He spoke to me, &ldquo;Have you been long in Yalta?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;About 6 days.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m starting my second week here.&rdquo; &ldquo;The sun rises and sets so quickly.&nbsp; I never can find anything to do with my small amounts of time.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m always so bored,&rdquo; I said, not once glancing at him.&nbsp; &ldquo;To say that Yalta is boring is like saying white is white.&nbsp; People never complain about other places such as Belyev, but when they come here &lsquo;Is there anything to do other than walk around?&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; I let out a giggle unaware of the effect it might cause.&nbsp; After dinner, we left the restaurant together, continuing our conversation about people, the sea, and the moonlight.&nbsp; He told me about his background: his hometown and his plethora of job opportunities.&nbsp; I told him about me: my marriage, my hometown, and that I would be staying in Yalta for a little while longer.&nbsp; I also allowed him the knowledge of my name, Anna Sergeyevna.&nbsp; </p>
<p>That night in my room I could not help but think of Mr. Gurov.&nbsp; He was fascinating and handsome, but there was something iniquitous about him.&nbsp; Why was such a man alone on such a beautiful night and why did he spend the evening conversing with me, a stranger?&nbsp; I am glad that I found someone to engage my interest.&nbsp; His pale gray eyes, his sleek gray hair, and manly build kept me pondering, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something mysterious about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About a week had passed since our first meeting.&nbsp; Mr. Gurov continuously offered me drinks and ices on such a parching day.&nbsp; That evening we walked to the pier to watch the steamer arrive.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t but think of the worst possible thoughts as we watched people descend from the steamer: What if my husband descends off the steamer this very night?&nbsp; How would I handle both men? What could I do to not hurt either one of them?&nbsp; I also couldn&rsquo;t help but think about how carefree Mr. Gurov made me feel while I was with him.&nbsp; With him I was able to be myself.&nbsp; His profile was striking.&nbsp; His slender nose juts out while his lips seem to invite me for a kiss.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t take my eyes off of him.&nbsp; He spoke to me about what a fine evening it turned out to be, but I turned away and smelled my flowers.&nbsp; After a few moments he swept me away in his arms and our lips met for the first time.&nbsp; With such passion in my heart, I couldn&rsquo;t pull away.&nbsp; I knew that what I was doing was wrong, but I couldn&rsquo;t resist him.&nbsp; His arms devoured my body and I just let him take me.&nbsp; </p>
<p>As he released, he cautiously checked to see if we had been spotted.&nbsp; Then breathing deeply into my ear, he uttered, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s meet in your room.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hesitant at first, I agreed to his proposal.&nbsp; My room was stuffy because of the humid weather, but smelt of scents my husband had bought for me when I left home.&nbsp; Mr. Gurov gazed at me as I was thinking, &ldquo;How do such encounters happen in such a strange way?&rdquo;&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t help but think of the emotions that filled my body when my husband and I first had this experience.&nbsp; This was something very special to me.&nbsp; I fell for Mr. Gurov at the spot, knowing that this couldn&rsquo;t, this shouldn&rsquo;t happen.&nbsp; </p>
<p>After this great and pleasurable, but wrong act took place, I whispered to Mr. Gurov, &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t right.&nbsp; You will never respect me anymore.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not only did I know that what had happened was horrible, I knew that Mr. Gurov wouldn&rsquo;t respect me as a woman.&nbsp; He would only want that one thing, that magic that we experienced.&nbsp; Minutes passed.&nbsp; Those minutes seemed like days, before Mr. Gurov responded to me.&nbsp; He had been at the table eating watermelon, while I was feeling such a huge burden in my heart.&nbsp; He replied, &ldquo;Why should I stop respecting you?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re saying.&rdquo; I knew what he was really thinking, &ldquo;I do respect you.&nbsp; I respect your body and every inch of it other than your heart.&nbsp; You can keep that.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t he understand? Had he no heart whatsoever? </p>
<p>I burst into tears repenting to God.&nbsp; Mr. Gurov still didn&rsquo;t understand the depth of these emotions.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why have I fallen into the trap? I am not a fallen woman.&nbsp; I no longer love myself.&nbsp; Not only have I deceived my husband, but myself as well.&nbsp; I have been doing this to myself for so long.&nbsp; My husband is a failure.&nbsp; He works doing God knows what, and I lied.&nbsp; I wanted something higher.&nbsp; I was full of such curiosity and I lied.&nbsp; I had to get away, so I told him I was ill.&nbsp; Why, who would do such an evil, deceitful thing?&rdquo;&nbsp; I knew that he still couldn&rsquo;t comprehend how much I felt the severity of this mistake. </p>
<p>&nbsp;I bawled in his shirt, about being snarled by the Devil as others had been previously.&nbsp; He pulled my face up, wiped the tears away, serenaded me with gentle words, and pressed his lips against mine.&nbsp; Soon enough we were laughing and kissing passionately, like nothing was ever wrong.</p>
<p>We took a carriage to Oreanda, where we sat and watched the rolling waves of the sea.&nbsp; As we sat there I couldn&rsquo;t help but think of the reality of beauty.&nbsp; In the early morning light everything was so beautiful-enchanted and soothing.&nbsp; I realized that everything in life is beautiful other than the corrupt minds and hearts and actions of humans.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We returned and continued to keep each other company.&nbsp; When we were alone in the park he would collect me in his arms and kiss me with full passion.&nbsp; Moments like these gave me the false hope that he truly did respect my body.&nbsp; At every instance allowable I tried to force it out of him.&nbsp; I wanted him to tell me that he didn&rsquo;t respect me, though he spent hour after hour by my side.&nbsp; He told me how beautiful and precious I was, though all I really wanted to hear was that he didn&rsquo;t really love me.&nbsp; I wanted him to be honest with me.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t want Mr. Gurov to lead me on any longer.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>A letter came informing me that I was needed back home.&nbsp; I had the quickest plans I could make for leaving.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing I&rsquo;m going.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the intervention of fate,&rdquo; I said to Mr. Gurov.&nbsp; I left in a carriage leaving him at the railway station.&nbsp; I needed just one last look at him, just ONE.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was the train began to roll away, I mouthed &ldquo;I shall think of you&hellip;I shall think of you all the time.&nbsp; We are parting forever. Never forget me.&nbsp; God bless you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the way back home, I knew that leaving was the best thing for me to do.&nbsp; How was I to know that Mr. Gurov, Dmitri rather, really loved and respected me? All I could do was think of his gray hair, and his pale and sad gray eyes and, this time, his gray suit.&nbsp; He seemed so sad.&nbsp; Maybe he really did love me? I guess I would never know, for I am returning to my husband, the man who needs me the most.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Home was different.&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t myself.&nbsp; Every waking moment I spent thinking of Dmitri and every night I dreamt of his eyes, his sad, pale, gray eyes.&nbsp; Oh how I longed for him to be here with me.&nbsp; How I wanted him to hold me and lay beside me like he used to.&nbsp; My husband didn&rsquo;t show me the affection I had experienced with Dmitri.&nbsp; He kissed me and made love to me, but each time it made me long for Dmitri more.</p>
<p>He decided to take me to see <em>The Geisha</em>.&nbsp; We entered the theater together, seating snuggly beside one another.&nbsp; I wish Dmitri was here with me.&nbsp; I tried to enjoy the operetta as much as possible.&nbsp; I enjoyed seeing such ladies of elegance surrounding me.&nbsp; During the first interval my husband went to join his friends for a smoke.&nbsp; I was seated by myself when I was approached my a familiar voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo;you do?&rdquo;&nbsp; As I glanced up to see who was there I was taken by surprise.&nbsp; I felt faint at the first glimpse.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t believe it.&nbsp; Was it really Mr. Gurov? In the background the violins and flutes played the sweet melodies of the country.&nbsp; I walked away.&nbsp; I jumped out of my seat, and walked off.&nbsp; What was I to say to him after such a sudden surprise? He followed me until we reached a dark narrow staircase.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why? Why did you come here?&nbsp; You have frightened me, almost to death,&rdquo; I spoke as I tried to gather my thoughts and emotions.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, Anna, try to understand, do try...&rdquo; As I gazed upon him with fear and love, I sob as I explained how unhappy I have been.&nbsp; I told him how I tried to forget, how I wanted to forget, but I couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; He grasped me close, my body against his as his lips touched my body.&nbsp; I drew back, asking him to stop.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have both gone mad now, first me, now you.&nbsp; Leave, go right this instance.&rdquo;&nbsp; As tears rolled down my cheeks I exclaimed, &ldquo;I have been so unhappy.&nbsp; I will come to Moscow for you.&nbsp; I swear it.&nbsp; Now we must part, my kind one, my darling, we must part.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had to leave him again just as I had before.&nbsp; Why must we so secretive about our love? All that mattered was what we thought was right?</p>
<p>Every few months I would go to Moscow.&nbsp; I would tell my husband that I was going to see a specialist for my illness, though I knew the truth.&nbsp; I stayed in the Slavyanski Bazaar, and sent a messenger to Mr. Gurov.&nbsp; No one knew what was going on.&nbsp; I was leading a double life, one here in Moscow and one with him.&nbsp; I was wearing the gray dress that matched his eyes.&nbsp; This time his gray eyes weren&rsquo;t sad.&nbsp; They were full, full of love and energy and respect, for me.&nbsp; As I looked into his eyes after the kiss, I cried.&nbsp; Tears streamed down my face as I tried to speak to him.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">I thought about the sadness of our lives.&nbsp; We couldn&rsquo;t love each other openly; it had to be kept a secret, as if we were thieves.&nbsp; As I looked at myself through the window I noticed the strands of gray pouring from the roots of my hair.&nbsp; This must be it.&nbsp; This was the love I had been searching for for a long time.&nbsp; I loved him as if he were my husband.&nbsp; Somehow I knew that he respected me and loved me.&nbsp; With tears still pouring, he consoled me, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry. You&rsquo;ve had your cry, now stop&hellip;&rdquo; He wanted to talk about how to fix the situation.&nbsp; We couldn&rsquo;t figure anything out, but we knew that whatever happened was the beginning, not the end of something, new and beautiful.&nbsp; The end was still far, far away.&nbsp; The hardest and most complicated part was truly at the beginning, finally being together, truthfully.</p>

<p align="center"><span class="style4">2) </span><span class="style3"><em>The Lady with the Dog Part Two</em><br>
by Brittni Rudisill </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;And they both realized that the end was still far, far away, and that the hardest, and most complicated part was only the beginning.&rdquo; (1502) As much as Dmitri wanted to live out his secret life, Anna&rsquo;s insecurities made this all but impossible. A love like theirs could not be forgotten but then again how could it work. As Dmitri begins to gray he realizes there is more to this double life he has been leading. For months they continued their secret affair, still coming to the point of questioning how could it work? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Dmitri certainly could not shake off his feelings for Anna and at his very sight Anna would cry, hard and long. She cried because it was the only way she knew how to deal with the pain of loving Dmitri, but not being able to completely fulfill their love she desperately longed for. Dmitri had given up asking her to stop, so she continued in hopes he wouldn&rsquo;t ask what the matter was. Anna had a secret that she felt she had to keep from Dmitri even though she wanted to tell him more than anything. It would certainly draw them even closer but this closeness was exactly what she was afraid of, and also wanted to avoid. It was that exact closeness that led to a new life being formed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of Anna and Dmitri&rsquo;s affair, she was pregnant with his child. If her dog could gasp, he would! For years, Anna and her husband were unable to conceive and one of her first nights with Dmitri proved to be magical. How could she tell him? The very thought made her weep even more. They were not yet strong enough to leave their other lives for one another. Then finally one night, she wept so hard, she screamed. Her tears were draining the life out of Dmitri, causing his hair to gray even faster. He finally Rudisill 2reached his breaking point and grabbed her, demanding to know why she was crying so intensely. Thoughts streamed through Anna&rsquo;s mind. Should she lie and tell him she was pregnant with her husband&rsquo;s child? She was so confused of how to actually leave her husband and if she told him the child was his, it would just be easier she thought. If she told Dmitri the truth, they could really be together but the thought lingered of how she would leave her other life. All she could get out was &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pregnant!&rdquo; She ran out of the room, leaving Dmitri to think: &ldquo;What would they do next? How could they work it out?&rdquo; Now it truly was fate that they were together. Some power was tapping them on the shoulder and telling them they have to be together, especially now for the child&rsquo;s sake. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Several weeks passed and Dmitri and Anna went on about their normal lives in their hometowns with their current spouses. Anna lied awake at night, softly crying. She was timid and shy and thought the best way to avoid more pain would be to stay with her husband and allow him to raise her child. He could provide a loving home for the baby and would never know it wasn&rsquo;t his. Then again she would never find a love like Dmitri&rsquo;s. Finally, Dmitri came back to S. and rented the same exact room that he stayed in during his first visit. Several times, he would stand outside of Anna&rsquo;s house, watching through the window with the long gray fence creating the insurmountable barrier separating Dmitri from his love. He no longer wanted to walk the streets of S. in hopes of just running into her. He wanted to rescue her from that horrible fence that caged her in, not allowing her to escape from the life she despised to find the one he now believed she longed for.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Dmitri stayed away from the orchestra this visit, however one night, when he was slowly eating dinner alone, Anna walked by the caf&eacute; where he was sitting. He caught her attention and although she was completely shocked, there was something about her look that convinced Dmitri he had made the right decision coming to find her. Seeing his face once again gave Anna a reassured hope that she could be happy. Then her husband rounded the corner with the Pomeranian and the all-to familiar words came out of her mouth, &ldquo;You must go away, did you hear me, you must leave now, I will come to you in Yalta, not Moscow, be waiting for me.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Exactly five days later, Dmitri was walking along the streets of Yalta when he came across the municipal park where he first saw Anna. There was a young woman with a multitude of large gray suitcases lined up around her, like a cage. The lady sat on a park bench with a dog sitting right next to her as Dmitri approached. The lady stood up and simply said, &ldquo;I left it all. I left it all for you.&rdquo; They were no longer afraid to show affection. In the middle of the municipal park, where he had first laid eyes on her, they kissed, releasing a great deal of the passion that had built up between them when they were apart. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Anna had taken that first hard step, the one most complicated and difficult. She left behind the life she had known for a new life in which she had no indication of what to expect. However, she did know that there was no conceivable way to shake off her feelings. For so long Anna was blinded by the appearance of love but after meeting Dmitri she realized the life with her husband was an utter joke, there was no real love between them, only a sense of safety. Dmitri had finally found what his heart had been longing for, a woman to love him as he loved her. He found all of his happiness in Anna&rsquo;s eyes and for the first time in his life Dmitri cried, just at the thought of her being his. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dmitri helped that lady carry all of her bags to a nearby bus. The bus that would lead Anna and Dmitri down the road to happiness, away from Yalta, Moscow and especially S. Several hundred miles later they arrived in the town where they and their new life would begin. No one who had previously known either of them would ever see them again. They moved into a large yellow house on the water with a fenceless yard. Dmitri was hired as a clerk for a female lawyer in town. Six months later Anna gave birth to their daughter, whom she names Grace after her ailing Pomeranian.&nbsp; The lady with a dog had gone from a boring, miserable life with only her canine companion by her side, to more than she ever dreamed of. Finally, Anna was that girl who proved to Dmitri that women were in the same race as men. Their new, beautiful life had begun. </p>
<p align="center"><span class="style3"><em>***<br>
</em></span><span class="style4">3) </span><span class="style3"><em>Lady in Venice</em><br>
by Mikhail Kim </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite of all her travels to various resorts and popular destinations, Anna Sergeyevna has never been to Venice.&nbsp; She watched the flat coastline approach at the horizon and felt the diminishing perception of the sea&rsquo;s expanse.&nbsp; No longer was she a lonely island in the midst of a vast expanse that could be so daunting, majestic, melancholy, glorious, and always so infinitely romantic.&nbsp; How could this body of water contain so much emotion and power to evoke such a strong awareness of her own existence and yet make her feel so insignificant?&nbsp; </p>
<p>But now the presence of this alien place was creeping into her reflective state, and she watched the coast as new details emerged and the great divide separating them slowly melted away.&nbsp; Dima barked at a group of older men emerging on deck from below.&nbsp; They disrupted Anna&rsquo;s reflections with loud jokes accompanied by disjointed bursts of laughter.&nbsp; They were obviously happy, having consumed a few rounds of drinks.&nbsp; One of them caught Anna&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp; Her heart skipped a beat as she looked more intently at his face.&nbsp; It couldn&rsquo;t have been Dmitry, but he had a few strikingly similar features.&nbsp; He had on a stylish dark grey suit which complemented his slightly elongated face.&nbsp; She had learned of Dmitry&rsquo;s passing two years ago by accident from a small notice in the paper.&nbsp; They haven&rsquo;t seen each other for years prior to that.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry dearest.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m doing this for your sake&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?... You can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she sobbed as grief filled her, and yet she knew that he was right.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t continue such a fragmented relationship.&nbsp; Perhaps they could have been happy together in another world.&nbsp; Conflicting memories of laughter and tears emerged in her mind.&nbsp; That was the last time she saw him after almost ten years of scattered rendezvous&rsquo;.&nbsp; Dmitry used to go to the same vacation destinations as her.&nbsp; On occasion, Anna&rsquo;s husband would decide to accompany her and Anna would get aggravated because then he would have intruded upon their vacation together.&nbsp; She never would have expected for something like this to endure this long.&nbsp; Then again, she never imagined parting with him.&nbsp; And now similar traits of the line of the nose and the high cheekbones of this unfamiliar man evoked these nostalgic and painful memories in her.&nbsp; </p>
<p>She turned away and was thankful that by now their ship was already entering the lagoon where they were to drop anchor.&nbsp; She wanted to get off the boat as soon as possible.&nbsp; It took her considerable effort to not look at the seemingly familiar man again.&nbsp; She notified one of the ship&rsquo;s men of her desire to disembark.&nbsp; Her baggage went down before her and another gondola floated up behind it to receive her.&nbsp; She bent down to pick up Dima.&nbsp; Anna and Dmitry bought him one autumn afternoon shortly after her previous dog died.&nbsp; She cast another quick glance at the vaguely familiar man before she gave her hand to be helped off the ship.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The group of intoxicated men on the deck watched the disembarking middle-aged lady with a dog.&nbsp; Despite her barely evident middle-age, she still carried very delicate, elegant and charming features.&nbsp; This lady also seemed to carry a feeling of strange withdrawal from her surroundings.&nbsp; She was obviously well respected and was of some prestige in society.&nbsp; She passed a quick glance over them before taking her Pomeranian and disembarking.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Anna settled down in her gondola and gave instructions to take her to the Hotel de Bains by the sea.&nbsp; Only then did she notice the city that surrounded her.&nbsp; She was in the heart of a bustling and lively marine thorough way.&nbsp; Gondoliers and their passengers called out to each other across the water.&nbsp; There was a small steamer preparing to depart as another arrived.&nbsp; She was immersed in a densely intricate and rich fabric of an old city that rose out of the water. It was a small human refuge that perched on the edge of the vast expanse of the sea.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Anna observed this unique life with a youthful fascination.&nbsp; Despite this, there was still a lingering remnant of the awakened image of Dmitry.&nbsp; After he left, her already fragile health slowly deteriorated and her husband encouraged her to take more leisure trips.&nbsp; So she traveled to many European resorts and had a number of short affairs and brief liaisons, all of which quickly brought back sorrowful memories of Dmitry.&nbsp; She finally couldn&rsquo;t take much more of the pain and grief they caused her and retreated into a distant and reserved shell.&nbsp; &ldquo;No more&rdquo; she told herself.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Anna arrived at the hotel and was very courteously received and shown to her room looking out to the sea.&nbsp; The beach was deserted save for a lonely figure walking along the water&rsquo;s edge.&nbsp; She gazed at it.&nbsp; It could have been Dmitry walking on that sand.&nbsp; She could go out and join him and they would walk together down by the water&rsquo;s edge and idly talk.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Early next morning Anna went out to walk out along the beach.&nbsp; Upon reaching the water&rsquo;s edge she started at a man&rsquo;s figure sitting on the sand some distance away.&nbsp; It was an overbearingly familiar pose and profile.&nbsp; She struggled to contain an urge to run towards him.&nbsp; However, almost unknowingly, she turned to walk in his direction all the while afraid to lift her eyes from the figure.&nbsp; It was a young man perhaps in his young twenties gazing out over the sea.&nbsp; What startled Anna so much was that he bore striking similarities to Dmitry.&nbsp; He had a very slender frame with pale white skin.&nbsp; He bore a thin line of the mouth with a slight curve up at the edges suggesting an ever so faint smile.&nbsp; He had deeply set eyes that peered out over the horizon.&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t distinguish their color, but she was sure that they would be a pale blue-grey.&nbsp; His slightly wavy and fairly long hair was ruffled in the uneven breeze of the sea.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Three weeks have passed since their first acquaintance.&nbsp; They walked along the beach together as they often did, their bare feet sinking into the coarse sand and leaving a fleeting trail behind them.&nbsp; They would find a deserted spot along the beach and sit next to each other.&nbsp; There was no need for many words between them.&nbsp; Sharing the silence and the sea around them was much greater meaning for them.&nbsp; </p>
<p>During the last few days Anna has been slowly realizing that they couldn&rsquo;t stay together.&nbsp; She did not have the spirit left in her to have another Dmitry in her life.&nbsp; Moreover she scarred him a little more with every blissful day they spent together.&nbsp; She would have to leave him.&nbsp; It would be for his sake that she does this.&nbsp; It was then that she truly understood Dmitry.&nbsp; It was a moment of great relief and an overflow of love for him.&nbsp; </p>
<p>They were sitting on the beach side by side.&nbsp; Anna turned to look at Tadzio&rsquo;s face near hers.&nbsp; His deep eyes gazed into the sea&rsquo;s expanse.&nbsp; She knew that they would part soon and that he would go on; and for the first time since her first trip to Yalta she felt at peace.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>FL 222 Poetry Presentation: Critical Skills </strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this assignment is for you to find an appropriate secondary source, such as an essay, article or portion of a book to use in formulating your personal understanding and interpretations of a poem. You will also become familiar with the Critical Thinking terminology that we will be using in the <a href="222Thesis exercise.html">Thesis Exercise</a> and <a href="222Paper2010.html">Term Paper</a>. Even if you are presenting with a partner, each student must choose a different article for this assignment.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <strong>Identify your resource</strong>. Start as soon as you choose your poem, since it may take some time and include a visit to DH Hill. To find an appropriate critical work for your project begin with the Selected Bibliographies in the back of The Norton Anthology (Pages A3-A10). You can also use the <a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/course/FL/222">Library Tools</a> page to see the many resources available to you from NCSU libraries or chat live with a Reference Librarian. Note: Wikipedia is a common starting point for information about an author or work, but you will need to go to peer-reviewed articles (some may be linked at the bottom of the page) to find appropriate criticism. This <a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/guides/litcrit/critics">page</a> from our Library Tools gives useful guidance. Coordinate with your partner(s), so that each person selects a different article. </p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> <strong>Complete the Critical Skills exercise</strong></p>

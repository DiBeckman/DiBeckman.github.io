<p class="style14"><b>DISCUSSION BOARD</b>: 
  WebCT Discussions<br />
  To enhance your 
  involvement with our texts and films, and extend class particpation outside of our limited 
  class time, you will be sharing observations and opinions on a class discussion 
  board. To access WebCT, go to <a href="http://vista.ncsu.edu">http://vista.nscu.edu</a> and log in with your Unity ID and password. Once logged in, you will be brought 
  to your <b>my Courses </b> page. Beneath the Courses header you will find links 
  to the home pages of classes in which you are enrolled that are using WebCT. Click on IDS 295-501 and 501. This will take you to the IDS 295-501 Web CT home  page. </p>
<p class="style14">If this is  your first visit to WebCT Vista, you can click on Student Resources on the WebCT page. From there, you can view instructional videos about Navigating in Vista and Discussions. </p>
<p class="style14">On the IDS 295-501 Course home page, you will also find the Discussion Icon where the various discussion topics are listed. </p>
<p class="style14">For help with WebCT Vista, follow the Help links or call 515-HELP.</p>
<p class="style14">For your first post, you will introduce yourself to the class and answer the following prompt by midnight on  <span class="style16">January 31 at midnight </span>:</p>
<p class="style14">Please introduce yourself briefly to the rest of the class. Next, imagine that the Study Abroad Office has awarded you with a dinner for three at the Tour Eiffel 58 restaurant. Consult the menus for the restaurant, and tell us: if you could invite any two French people, alive, dead or fictional, to dine with you, whom would you invite and why? What would you order?</p>
<p class="style14">The menus are posted at <a href="http://www.restaurants-toureiffel.com/english/restaurant-tour-eiffel-58.html">http://www.restaurants-toureiffel.com/english/restaurant-tour-eiffel-58.html</a></p>
<p class="style14">As explained on the <a href="ParisArts2010.html">Syllabus</a>, your  first posts on your reading are due by midnight on <span class="style16">February 14</span>, and the second posts are due by midnight on <span class="style18">March 7</span>. Undergraduates are required to read and post on at least 2 books under the headings <em><strong>Historical Overview</strong></em> and <em><strong>Memoirs and Literature</strong></em>. Graduates are required to read and post on 3 books under those headings. You are also welcome to subtitute another similar book that we have not listed--simply contact the professors to see that it is added to the list.</p>
<p class="style14">You are also required to post on  films from two different historical periods by <span class="style16">February 14</span><strong>,</strong> and the remaining two historical periods by <span class="style16">March 7.</span> Undergraduates are asked to post about a total of four films and graduate students a total of 6 films.  All students are required to post on a French intercultural communication book and the plays by Ionesco by <span class="style16">March 7</span><strong>,</strong> as well.</p>
<p class="style14">You may also post on as many works as you like under the <strong><span class="style13">Additional  novels, films, poems set
in Paris</span></strong> category for extra credit. </p>
<p class="style14">Your posts should be at least 1-3 paragraphs long, but there is no upper limit, since students vary greatly in how much they have to say and the works themselves are highly varied. Your post should be based on the entries in your Class Porfolio. Choose the most interesting, informative, surprising, provacative aspects of the work to comment on in your post. You may also wish to include your opinion of the work and your favorite passage(s) or scene(s). </p>

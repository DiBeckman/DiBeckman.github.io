<p class="style1"> &ldquo;Known by many names&mdash;&lsquo;The City of Lights,&rsquo; &lsquo;The City of Love,&rsquo; &lsquo;Gay Paree&rdquo;&mdash;Paris is . . . one of Europe&rsquo;s oldest and most celebrated cities.  Behind the famous monuments such as the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre museum, and the Champs-Elys&eacute;es, Paris is a bustling cosmopolitan metropolis, with business of all kinds and colorful local culture, enriched by decades of immigration from France&rsquo;s former colonies.  The city prides itself on the beauty of its architecture and has strict laws about building inside the city limits in order to preserve its charm.  It is also associated with the world&rsquo;s best gastronomy, fashion, and hospitality.  Paris has its origins in Roman times, as evidenced by ancient ruins within the city.&rdquo;  To understand European and American history, understanding Paris is essential.  This class will introduce students to the French language (a major influence on English), and look at the role Paris played and still plays on the world stage. <br />
  <br />
  There are no pre-requisites for the course.&nbsp;The language of instruction is English. There will be intensive French tourist language instruction as part of on-campus, pre-departure classes. Students proficient in French will be able to submit the final paper in French. </p>

<p class="style1">Sunday, April 18: Deadline to send your arrondissement photos to Chandler:</p>
<p class="style1">&quot;Pick your favorite picture (only one) from each arrondissement that you have and send them to me ( <a href="mailto:chan2565@gmail.com">chan2565@gmail.com</a>).  I figure this will be easier and less stressful on you, and that way I can do some picture quality/size control because we have limited upload space.  Let me know if you have and questions/problems with the attached image/sending me your pictures, I'll be glad to help.&quot;</p>
<p class="style1">We do not expect you to have pictures of EACH arrondissement. I realize that we would have needed another week to do that! We do expect each students to submit 8-10 photos. I recommended naming each photo with the arrondissement number and your name.</p>

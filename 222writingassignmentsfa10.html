<h2 class="class">Class 2 (Pope, Lecture 1) <span class="date">due Friday, August 20 </span></h2>
<p> Read the argument (summary) and first stanza of Pope's <span class="text">Essay on Man</span>. Write a page about the first stanza (lines 1-16) answering Shannon's 4 questions*.</p>
<ol class="unspaced">
  <li>What is confusing?</li>
  <li>What is repeated?</li>
  <li>What is familiar?</li>
  <li>What is strange?</li>
</ol>
<p>*This and all subsequent references to Shannon are from Edward Shannon's <span class="text">The Prentice Hall Guide to Writing about Literature</span> (Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2002) which went out of print in 2010. I have replaced it with <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> this semester. </p>
<p> Print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222Enlightenment.html">The Enlightenment</a> and <a href="222GreatChain.html">The Great Chain of Being</a> </p>
<p>In addition, for this and the next assignment, take a look at  my web page on <a href="Explication.html"><em>Explication de Texte</em></a> and these web sites about figures of speech which are also listed on the handy <a href="222supmatf04.html">Supplementary Materials</a> page. These pages will  be useful for your <a href="222poetrypresentation.html">Poetry Presentation</a> due <span class="date">Friday, September 10</span> and <span class="date">Monday, September 13</span>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Here is <a href="http://grammar.about.com/od/terms/a/revquiz20terms.htm?p=1">a quiz</a> you can take to assess your knowledge of the &quot;Top 20 figures of speech&quot; by Richard Norquist.</li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.nipissingu.ca/faculty/williams/figofspe.htm">This site</a> contains figures of speech, thought, repetition, more than you can shake a stick at! Most examples are drawn from Shakespeare. </li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/rhetoricaldevicesinsound.htm">This site</a> is very cool because it has sound clips and draws from a wide range of speeches, movies, and more to illustrate the Figures of Speech. For example, see and listen to quotes from Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln, and Neil Armstrong on <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/figures/antithesis.htm">the page about antitheses</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="class">Class 3 (Pope, Lecture 2) <span class="date">due Monday, August 23</span></h2>
<ol>
  <li>Print out <a href="AcademicIntegrityPledge.html">Academic Integrity form</a>. Please sign, date, and turn in. </li>
  <li>Read <span class="text">Essay on Man</span> and write a page about your stanza to turn in. In case you're not sure what a <em>stanza</em> is, you can look this and other literary terms up in our course <a href="222Glossary.html">Glossary</a>, the Glossary in Appendix B of <span class="text">A Short Guide to Writing About Literature</span>, or a web site such as <a href="http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms.html">http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms.html</a>. <br />
    <br />
    Note that the Roman numerals I-X at the beginning of each stanza correspond to your assigned stanza number (not a page or line number). What is the stanza about? Give a one sentence summary. Answer the Shannon's 4 questions. Also, what are the key words and images in the stanza? How does the stanza connect with the ideas of the Enlightenment we've discussed? What is  the attitude of the narrator? What is the role of nature, especially animals, if any appear in your stanza?</li>
  <li> Read Chapters 1 and 2 in <span class="text">A Short Guide to Writing About Literature </span></li>

</ol>
<h2 class="class"> Class 4 (Voltaire, Lecture 1) <span class="date"> due Wednesday, August 25 </span></h2>
<ol class="spaced">
  <li> Print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222ShortStoryNovel.html">Different Forms of Prose Fiction</a>; <a href="222SatireIronyUtopia.html">Satire, Irony and Utopia</a>. Read <a href="222Panglossian.htm">Panglossian</a>. </li>
  <li> Write a page about the first thirteen chapters of <span class="text">Candide</span> answering Shannon's 4 questions.</li>
  <li> Read Chapter 10 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>. </li>
  <li> Weekly vocabulary quizzes? I recommend that you sign up for the free edition of Anu Gang's <a href="http://wordsmith.org/awad/subscribe.html">A Word a Day</a>. Last semester, a student volunteer prepared a 5-question matching quiz based on the week's words that was posted on the board each Friday. He received a bonus of 2 points on his final grade for writing and bringing the quizzes to class each Friday. Students wrote the answers to the quiz on their homework and I added a point on the midterm or final each time a student got 3 quizzes completely correct. We will do this again provided I have a volunteer quiz-meister. <a href="mailto:Diane_Beckman@ncsu.edu">Email</a> me if you are interested: first come, first served. </li>
  <li>Consider bookmarking an online dictionary, such as <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/">dictionary.com</a> or <a href="http://www.m-w.com/">Merriam-Webster</a> to make it easy to look up words you don't know. If you are doing the Reading Notebook, you can print out the definitions to include in your notebook. </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="class">Class 5 (Voltaire, Lecture 2) <span class="date">due Friday, August 27</span></h2>
<ol>
  <li> Discuss the following questions after you do the reading assignment (Chapters 14-22). Quote from the text with examples to support your answers and include the page reference for each quotation.
    <ul>
      <li>Is Eldorado a genuine utopia or (in one critic's words) &quot;a colossal bore&hellip;satirized by Voltaire as foolish and futile&quot;?</li>
      <li>Which specific behaviors or institutions show us that Voltaire wants the reader to see Eldorado as utopic?</li>
      <li>Does Voltaire have a philosophical lesson in mind or is it pure satire? Or both?</li>
      <li>How does it correspond to your personal view of Utopia?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>See Lecture Notes on <a href="222dulce.html">Dulce et utile</a>.</li>
  <li>The first original contribution post&mdash;on Pope&mdash;is due Friday at midnight. You will have many authors to choose from to do your required 13 posts (7 original contributions and 6 responses), but I encourage you to get in the habit of posting by starting with Pope or Voltaire. For an original contribution post, make a point or develop an argument of at least 7 lines based on something you read, learned or thought while reading <em>An Essay on Man</em>. Ask a question or make a provocative statement for your classmates to respond to. Did something in your homework get praise or a lot of comment from me? If so, it might be the basis of a good post. </li>
</ol>
<h2><span class="class">Class 6 (Voltaire, Lecture 3)</span> <span class="date">due Monday, August 30 </span></h2>
<p>Read the page in Supplementary Materials, <a href="Candide%20quotes.html">Quotes from different critics about &quot;Il faut cultiver notre jardin.&quot; </a> Write a page which includes answers the following questions: what are some  literal and figurative meanings of the word <em>garden</em>? How do they apply to Candide's garden? How do <strong>you</strong> interpret the final line of the story? </p>
<p>To help you to understand the difference between <strong>literal</strong> and <strong>figurative</strong>, here is  an example I found online:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>literal</strong> vs. <strong>figurative</strong> meaning - relates to the meanings of words and phrases or expressions. For example, &quot;She was all ears&quot; has a <strong>figurative</strong> meaning (She was listening intently) as well as a <strong>literal</strong> meaning (Her body was composed of ears or she had a huge set of ears). <span class="citation"><a href="http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm">Literary Terms for English</a></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finish reading <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> 1215-1249.</p>
<p>Writing assignments</p>
<ol>
  <li> Finish your character sketch to turn in.</li>
  <li>Choose any one of the following questions to answer and include the question with your answer. These questions would also inspire some good discussions in your Moodle posts.</li>
</ol>
<div class="maroon">
  <h3>FORMALIST CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How does Emma's Romantic nature conflict/contribute to the story's 
      Realist nature?</li>
    <li>How does Flaubert use descriptions and writing style to make the reader feel the same way that the character feels?</li>
    <li>How does Emma's insatiable desire for passionate affairs relate to her Romantic sensibility?</li>
    <li> Would the author be successful as a Romantic author?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h3>SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
<div class="red">
  <h4>Marxist Criticism:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>How do Emma's feelings towards her class status affect the decisions she chooses to make throughout the novel? Why do you think Flaubert chooses to portray Emma like this, but allows Charles to be content with their status?</li>
    <li>How does Flaubert portray social class in <span class="text">Madame Bovary </span>and how does it show his own feelings about class?</li>
    <li>If Emma was not satisfied with her social status before she married Charles, when why she did marry a not romantic man that is also not wealthy?</li>
    <li>How does the economy, the amount of money available to characters and their social class affect their lives and mentality?</li>
    <li>If the characters' social classes were switched, how different would the story be?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="purple">
  <h4>Feminist Criticism: </h4>
  <ul>
    <li> What are the different roles and duties between men and women in <span class="text">Madame Bovary </span>? eg: Charles, the doctor; Homais, pharmacist; Rouault, farmer. Do women take on any duties or have to work? Does this depend on class structure? eg Wet nurse, F&eacute;licit&eacute;.</li>
    <li>How are women's desires/dreams different from men's in <span class="text">Madame Bovary </span>?</li>
    <li>The way that women are portrayed seems to be that they are dreamers and naive? Does that have to do with the time period and the way they seemed back then?</li>
    <li>Through the creation of Emma's character, is Flaubert trying to hinder feminism by trying to show how the female sex cannot fulfill her role efficiently because she is distracted by passion and material goods?</li>
    <li>In what ways does Flaubert continuously build a theme of discontent in women throughout <span class="text">Madame Bovary </span></li>
    <li> How do Emma's romantic ideas influence the plot of the story?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="teal">
  <h3>CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>What significance does the cathedral and the priest trying to show Emma and Leon every last part of it have in the story? What commentary is the author trying to get across by including it?</li>
    <li>Why does Madame Bovary love the romantic period so much, while this novel was written during the realist period?</li>
    <li>What role does the Industrial Revolution play in the society in which Madame Bovary lives?</li>
    <li> How does culture affect the feelings/ideas of the characters in the story?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="orange">
  <h3>PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Do any of the characters show symptoms of any psychological disorders? If so, why would the author choose this as an explanation for their actions, feelings, and characteristics?</li>
    <li> Does Emma's inablity to be happy relate to Flaubert's psychological feelings?</li>
    <li>What does Charles' mother's emotions toward Emma reveal about her psychological state?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="blue">
  <h3>READER RESPONSE CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> How  do Madame Bovary's romantic desires and her situation affect/relate to your own current desires and dreams?</li>
    <li> After having read <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span>, do you see your own desires and dreams in a different light?</li>
    <li>How would you describe Emma's feelings toward Berthe and how might this have been different if Berthe had been a boy?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="green">
  <h3>ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> How does nature enhance the relationship of the characters in the scene or the mood of the scene?</li>
    <li>How does the author personify the environmnet to enhance the characters' traits? Espcially with Emma and L&eacute;on? Does the author's tone change? His writing style? </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="fuchsia">
  <h3>QUEER THEORY: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Is Emma's infidelity due to her displeasure with Charles or to her displeasure with her social standing?</li>
    <li>Do you think that since Emma knows Leon, Charles, and Justin are all in love with her that it is affecting her emotions? Is having too many lovers making her become more depressed/crazy?</li>
    <li> How do the cultural feelings about sex affect the characters, plots, and themes in
      <span class="text">
      Madame Bovary</span>?</li>
  </ul>

    <li>How does living in a patriarchal society affect the women in the story? How do you know it is a patriarchal society?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="teal">
  <h3>CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>What is the reason behind the author's pessimistic view of authority?</li>
    <li><span class="text">The Metamorphosis</span>, published in 1915, is an expressionistic work. Expressionism was a writing and thought style in Germany from 1910-1925. How does the story exhibit Expressionist traits?</li>
    <li>In this time period, men are still responsible for taking care of the household finances and thinking rationally, while the women take care of the home and family. How are these stereotypical roles represented and also misrepresented?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="orange">
  <h3> PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Could the way that Gregor's parents do not understand him have to do with the way Franz Kafka feels in life as if nobody listens?</li>
    <li>Why does Kafka choose to turn Gregor into a unknown insect and why is he the only one who cares for other people?</li>
    <li>Each character reacts to Gregory's metamorphosis in a different way. What do these reactions tell us about the psyche of each individual?</li>
    <li> How does Gregory seeing himself as a bug reveal his personality and psychological state?</li>
    <li>Gregory does not freak out when he wakes up as a bug like normal people would. What does this say about Gregory psychologically?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="blue">
  <h3> READER RESPONSE CRITICISM</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How do you respond to the family's treatment of Gregor? Consider both Gregory's condition as an insect and feelings.</li>
    <li>Why is there no reason given for his transformation?</li>
    <li>Kafka's choice of an insect can be interpreted in many different ways. Why do you think Kakfa chose an insect for the Gregory character?</li>
    <li>How do you respond to the way the author intorduces Gregory Samsa to the readers?</li>
    <li>Has there ever been a time (thinking back) that you could relate to the feeling of Gregor as he awoke or even as he lived after the change? If not, could you relate it to a real life scenario, something that could have happened to you?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="green">
  <h3> ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> What is the importance of the alarm clock?</li>
    <li> How does being in his home affect how drastic the memamorphosis is to his family?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="fuchsia">
  <h3>QUEER THEORY</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How did Gregory's family change before and after his &quot;insect&quot; transformation? </li>
    <li>How does Gregor's sudden transformation change the interaction he has with the other characters? Do you think this has any similarities to the interaction with others that a homosexual receives after &quot;coming out of the closet&quot;?</li>
    <li>How is this story a depiction of homophobia and prejuidice in 1910's Germany? </li>
    <li>What is the human mind capable of? What is the human heart able to withstand?</li>

<h2><span class="class">Class 38 (Thesis exercise and Peer review of Term Paper) </span><span class="date">due Wednesday, November 17</span></h2>
<p>The first part of class will be devoted to <em>The Thesis Exercise</em>. Read the <a href="222Thesis exercise.html">web page</a> about how to write a thesis for a literary paper. Print and fill out the <a href="222Theses.html">page of sample FL 222 theses</a> where you rate the examples. The second half of class will be devoted to peer review of the first draft of your Paper. Print out <strong>two copies</strong> of the <a href="PeerReviewFeedback.html">Peer Review Feedback Form</a> to include with the <strong>two copies</strong> of your draft which you will bring for your classmate&gt;s. Fill out the top part of the form with your name, paper title, and date. Do not wait until the last minute to print these materials out. Email me before class if you have an idea for your own original topic so that I can approve it. Speaking of original, a very creative paper written by a former student is featured <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~dsbeckma/To Hell with Literature.htm"> here:</a></p>
<p>Selected writing advice from <a href="222Paper2010.html">Paper:</a></p>
<h3>Choose your topic</h3>
<p>Read through the topic choices below. Consult Chapter 10 in <span class="text"> A Short Guide, Writing about Fiction: the World of the Story</span>, especially the pages on &quot;Getting Ideas&quot; (171-5).  Which texts have been your favorite or challenged you the most? Send me an email or make an appointment if you need help deciding on a topic.
</p>
<h3>Steps for writing </h3>
<p>Step 1: read, re-read and annotate your texts; write preliminary notes; build up to a fully formulated thesis. A thesis is a clear and specific argument, not a list, not an opinion, not an obvious fact.</p>
<p>See the <a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/course/FL/222">Library Tools</a> page to see resources available to you from NCSU libraries. </p>
<p>Step 2: Following <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>, Chapter 3; write a first draft of 1-2 pages about one of the topics below for the peer review session. It should have a working title and a fully formulated introduction (you can rewrite them later, but they need to be there for the draft) and several finished paragraphs; your audience knows the text, so you should avoid plot summaries. Use the present tense for literary analysis: Ivan <strong>is</strong> an ambitious&hellip; Flaubert <strong>reveals</strong>&hellip; Include your outline. This is the peer review draft version of your paper; print and bring 2 copies of it to class. Include the <a href="PeerReviewFeedback.html">Peer Review Feedback form</a> with each copy.</p>
<p>Some useful pages (among many) about writing:</p>
<ul>
  <li> For the difference between formal and informal style: <a href="http://www.mondofacto.com/study-skills/writing/how-to-use-academic-writing-style/04.html">http://www.mondofacto.com/study-skills/writing/how-to-use-academic-writing-style/04.html</a>.</li>
  <li>For guidelines about  commas, see <a href="http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/commas.html">http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/commas.html</a></li>
  <li>For writing anxiety or writer's block, see <a href="http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/writing_anxiety.html">http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/writing_anxiety.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. Beckman's hint about titles: A dull title sets expectations low. A good title invites the reader! Quotes, proverbs or aphorisms make great titles. Try a google search with a key word from your thesis (pride, satisfaction, quest, etc) and the word quote. I've already got a <a href="222Lovequotes.html">web page</a> with love quotes for you to use, since love is such a popular topic. </p>

<h2><span class="class">Class 41 (Paper Full Draft)</span><span class="date"> due Monday, November 29</span></h2>
<p>No class meeting, but you should come to the classroom to drop off the complete draft of your paper. See the <a href="222Paper2010.html">Paper</a> page for full details.
  Highlights include:</p>
<p>-Step 3: Reflect on your peer reviewers' suggestions and write a full draft of your paper to turn in to me. Proofread following the <span class="text">Editing</span> and other checklists listed on the inside cover of <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>. I will not grade the paper at this point but will return it to you with comments, so that you can write the final draft. Consult the <a href="222scoringrubric.html">Scoring Rubric for Papers</a> and <a href="222scoringrubric-rewrite.html">Scoring Rubric for Creative Papers</a> so that you'll know what I will be looking for when I do grade the paper.</p>
<ul><li>Chapter 14 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> is an exellent presentation of the style and format I expect in  a literary paper. Pay attention to good organization and logical transitions between paragraphs.</li>
  <li>Base your arguments on close readings of the texts you have chosen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two areas that are normally weak in the first draft are the use of quotations and the conclusion.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Give concrete examples (quotes) from 
    the texts to support your arguments, but not to fill up space.  These quotations are the evidence you need to provide to prove your thesis. You will usually use at least one in each of body paragraphs.</li>
  <li>In order to integrate quotes appropriately, first introduce the quote by making the point, connected to your thesis, that the passage illustrates. Next, include the quote, usually 3-5 lines of text. Finally, tie the quote back into your argument with a concluding sentence in your own words: &quot;&hellip;remind your reader that these passages are there to prove a point. End your discussion on your words, not theirs.&quot; (Shannon, 162-3).</li>
</ul>
<p>A conclusion is very important to a fully developed paper. Go beyond the ideas in your introduction. Have you proved your thesis?  All readers, including your professor, will ask the question: &quot;So what?&quot; The conclusion should make the relevance and importance of your research clear.</p>
<p>You are not required to use secondary sources (books, articles, internet) for this paper, but if you do, be sure to quote and document them properly and attach a &#147;Works Cited&#148; page. <strong>Plagiarism is a poor choice and will not be tolerated</strong>; consult the <a href="222CIfa10.html">Course Information</a> page about the NC State academic integrity policy; ask me if questions remain. For information on using research (if you do) and writing the documentation page, consult <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>, chapter 15.</p>

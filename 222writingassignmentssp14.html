  <p>*This and all subsequent references to Shannon are from Edward Shannon's <span class="text">The Prentice Hall Guide to Writing about Literature</span> (Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2002) which went out of print in 2010. I  replaced it with <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> as a textbook for our class. Details about what he means by &quot;confusing, repeated, familiar and strange&quot; can be found <a href="222Shannonmore.html">here</a>.</p>
  <p>Write a one-paragraph to one-page summary of Chapter 1 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>. Include the title of each chapter in your heading, since   it should reflect the main point of the chapter. Your summary should include the main points and any others that seem especially helpful or surprising to you. Some students prefer to an outline format or question format. (See <a href="222ShortGuideSample.pdf">this example</a> of a question format and <a href="222ASGoutline.pdf">this example</a> of an outline format.) Outlining, writing questions, and summarizing are all useful skills. You may handwrite or type it, and you may include it on the same page with your discussion of the first stanza of <span class="text">Essay on Man. </span>You may submit<span class="text"> A Short Guide</span> assignments electronically since I will not make extensive comments on them. If they are submitted electronically, they will be returned to you electronically. </p>
  <p> Print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222Enlightenment.html">The Enlightenment</a> and <a href="222GreatChain.html">The Great Chain of Being</a> if you want to use them to take notes.</p>
<p>In addition, for this and the next assignment, take a look at  my web page on <a href="Explication.html"><em>Explication de Texte</em></a> and these web sites about figures of speech which are also listed on the handy <a href="222supmatf04.html">Supplementary Materials</a> page. These pages will  be useful for your <a href="222poetrypresentation.html">Poetry Presentation</a> due on <span class="date">January 29 and 31.</span></p>

    <li>Here is <a href="http://grammar.about.com/od/terms/a/revquiz20terms.htm?p=1">a quiz</a> you can take to assess your knowledge of the &quot;Top 20 figures of speech&quot; by Richard Norquist.</li>
    <li> <a href="http://www.nipissingu.ca/faculty/williams/figofspe.htm">This site</a> contains figures of speech, thought, repetition, more than you can shake a stick at! Most examples are drawn from Shakespeare. </li>
    <li> <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/rhetoricaldevicesinsound.htm">This site</a> is very cool because it has sound clips and draws from a wide range of speeches, movies, and more to illustrate the Figures of Speech. For example, see and listen to quotes from Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln, and Neil Armstrong on <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/figures/antithesis.htm">the page about antitheses</a>.</li>

  <ol>
    <li>Read <span class="text">Essay on Man</span> and write a page about your stanza to turn in. In case you're not sure what a <em>stanza</em> is, you can look this and other literary terms up in our course <a href="222Glossary.html">Glossary</a>, the Glossary in Appendix B of <span class="text">A Short Guide to Writing About Literature</span>, or a web site such as <a href="http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms.html">http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms.html</a>. <br />
      <br />
Note that the Roman numerals I-X at the beginning of each stanza correspond to your assigned stanza number (not a page or line number). What is the stanza about? Give a one-sentence summary. Answer  Shannon's 4 questions. Also, what are the key words and images in the stanza? How does the stanza connect with the ideas of the Enlightenment we've discussed? What is  the attitude of the narrator? What is the role of nature, especially animals, if any appear in your stanza?</li>
    <li>Write a one-paragraph to one-page summary or outline of Chapter 2 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> to turn in. Take, correct, and turn in your answers to the Quiz in Appendix B  364-371 of <span class="text">A Short Guide.</span></li>

<h2 class="class">Class 5 (Voltaire, Lecture 2) <span class="date">due Wednesday, January 15</span></h2>
<ul><li> Discuss the following questions after you do the reading assignment (Chapters 14-22). Quote from the text with examples to support your answers and include the page reference for each quotation.
          <ul>
            <li>Is Eldorado a genuine utopia or (in one critic's words) &quot;a colossal bore&hellip;satirized by Voltaire as foolish and futile&quot;?</li>
            <li>Which specific behaviors or institutions show us that Voltaire wants the reader to see Eldorado as utopic?</li>
            <li>Does Voltaire have a philosophical lesson in mind or is it pure satire? Or both?</li>
            <li>How does it correspond to your personal view of Utopia?</li></ul>
        </li>
</ul>
<ul><li>See Lecture Notes on <a href="222dulce.html">Dulce et utile</a>.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Read Chapter 3 in <em>A Short Guide</em> and write a summary to turn in.</li></ul>
 <ul><li>The first original contribution post&mdash;on Pope&mdash;is due <span class="date">tonight</span> at midnight. You will have many authors to choose from to do your required 14 posts (7 original contributions and 7 responses), but I encourage you to get in the habit of posting by starting with Pope or Voltaire. For an original contribution post, make a point or develop an argument of at least <span class="red">one  full paragraph (5-8 sentences)</span> based on something you read, learned or thought while reading <em>An Essay on Man</em>. Ask a question or make a provocative statement for your classmates to respond to. You may also include a quote from the text under discussion or links to other web sites. Did something in your homework get praise or a lot of comment from me? If so, it might be the basis of a good post.</li></ul>
          <h2><span class="class">Class 6 (Voltaire, Lecture 3)</span> <span class="date">due Friday, January 17</span></h2>
          <p>Read the page in Supplementary Materials, <a href="Candide%20quotes.html">Quotes from different critics about &quot;Il faut cultiver notre jardin.&quot;</a> Write a page which includes answers to the following questions: what are some  literal and figurative meanings of the word <em>garden</em>? How do they apply to Candide's garden? How do <strong>you</strong> interpret the final line of the story? </p>
          <p>To help you to understand the difference between <strong>literal</strong> and <strong>figurative</strong>, here is  an example I found online:</p>
<blockquote>
            <p><strong>literal</strong> vs. <strong>figurative</strong> meaning - relates to the meanings of words and phrases or expressions. For example, &quot;She was all ears&quot; has a <strong>figurative</strong> meaning (She was listening intently) as well as a <strong>literal</strong> meaning (Her body was composed of ears or she had a huge set of ears). <span class="citation"><a href="http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm">Literary Terms for English</a></span></p>

            <li>Choose any one of the following questions to answer and<strong> include the question </strong>with your answer. These questions would also inspire some good discussions in your Moodle posts.</li>
          </ol>
          <ol>
            <div class="maroon">
              <h3>FORMALIST CRITICISM:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>How do the names of individual characters tie into the main messages within <em>Madame Bovary</em>?  Are the names meant to hold hidden significance (Leon could be lion, Justin could be justice, Rodolphe could be rodent, etc.)? </li>
                <li>How does Flaubert's use of free indirect discourse reinforce the overall meaning of the story(is it simply stylistic or does it enhance the meaning)? </li>
                <li>Flaubert alters the tempo throughout <em>Madame Bovary</em>, by briefly mentioning certain events and going into great length on others. What is the purpose of this and how does this benefit the story?</li>
                <li>Does Emma's taste in literature have a specific connection to the plot of <em>Madame Bovary</em>?  If so, what is the significance of these allusions and how do they enhance the plot?</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
            <div class="red">
              <h4>Marxist Criticism:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>How do economic conditions determine Emma's actions in <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span>?</li>
                <li>Which social class is Flaubert frustrated with and how does he portray this in the story?</li>
                <li>In <em>Madame Bovary</em>, who represents the proletariat social class and who represents the bourgeoisie? What affect do these social classes have on the characters' views on themselves in society?</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="purple">
              <h4>Feminist Criticism: </h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Would Emma still be existentially bored and frustrated if she were a man? Would her manner of dealing with her problems change in any way?</li>
                <li>What was the level of freedom for women in Flaubert's day? Were they lived in more restricted life or had a choice to make decisions? <br />
                  Were they allowed to complain about their life or did they just have to deal with it?</li>
                <li>Emma seems to blame her unhappiness, and inability to achieve her romantic ideals, on the constraints that are put on women. She harbors a resentment towards the freedom she perceives men to have that women do not, and this is a source of much of her frustration and enhanced depression/bipolar like symptoms. It is for this reason she wanted to have a son and not a daughter. Do you think that if she had given birth to a son, instead of a daughter, she would have been a more loving mother? </li>
                <li>How do the societal expectations and differences in education between men and women at the time influence the opportunities of the characters <br />
                in the novel to fulfill their goals and desires? How does Flaubert showcase the differences in opportunities for men and women through Emma's marriage and affairs?</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="teal">
              <h3>CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>How may have Emma Bovary’s life been different if her story had taken place in one hundred years later (1950/1960’s) and how different would it have been if it had taken place current day, as opposed to the 1800's? (Dr. B adds: For one person's answer, read  <a href="http://www.woodyallen.art.pl/eng/kugelmass_episode.php"><em>The Kugelmass Episode</em></a> by Woody Allen about Emma Bovary arriving in New York City in 1977. )</li>
                <li>What would Emma do/How would she react if she was suddenly moved down (or up) a class level? That is to say, if she were to become very very poor, or very very rich and influential instead of her current middle class life?</li>
                <li>Suppose you were to make a movie production of <em>Madame Bovary</em>, set in contemporary USA (think <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0525303/?ref_=tt_ov_dr" target="_blank">Baz Luhrmann</a>'s <em>Romeo + Juliet</em> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117509/" target="_blank">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117509/</a> with Leonardo DiCaprio, but not to a word-for-word rewrite.) What would be the most interesting social, historical, or economic hurdle to work around to make your production both true to the writing and believable to the viewer? Would something in particular be impossible to work around? Choose your favorite character and describe their modern day job and tell us what they would be wearing when first seen on camera. Choose your favorite setting (perhaps a house, the golden lion, or Homais' workshop) and describe how you imagined it when reading <em>Madame Bovary</em> and how you would create the set on the film.</li>
                <li>Does  Part III of the novel reflect anything from the author's life history that may have influenced this piece?</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="orange">
              <h3>PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </h3>

                <li>In <em>Madame Bovary, </em>what examples from the text suggest that Emma may actually be suffering from a mental illness? Which mental illness do you think this is and why? </li>
                <li>What does the author express about desire? How does Flaubert express desire in the text through characters like Emma and Leon?</li>
                <li>Why was Emma so unsuccessful in marriage? Was she fated to be unsuccessful because of her obsession with emotions evidenced from a young age, or did her infatuation with romantic novels set her up for failure?</li>
                <li>Why does Emma feel the need to be married and why does her heart decide to take a different turn in love? What symbols portray her actions when Emma falls for another man? Is this betrayal against Charles, or is this a new love that is being shed on Emma that she was originally looking for?</li>
                <li>why does Charles suddenly start to visualize and witness Emma in a way he has never seen any other woman before? Charles goes on describing her body parts, her hair, fingernails, etc. Is there an environmental aspect that plays a role in this? How is this going to change the emotions of the characters later on in the story when the truth gets exposed?</li>
                <li>After learning his personal background and studying the way Gustave Flaubert puts parts of his own personality into his writing, do any of the characters or aspects of characters appear to be constructed around himself or his own life?</li>
                <li>Would Emma be satisfied if she were to elope with Monsieur Leon? Or would Emma still have the desire to sate her needs for her fantasy novel life? If so, could Monsieur Leon handle Emma's desire, or is there a greater man for her?</li>

                <li>What significance do you think nature has had on Madame Bovary? Does she yearn for nature like the romantic poets or during the Enlightenment period? Does the fact that she grew up surrounded by nature show anything about how she wanted to live life?</li>
                <li>Gustave Flaubert is metaphor heavy when it comes to comparing people with animals, farm animals in particular. How does the extended metaphor, people are like farm animals, affect the theme(s) of <span class="text">Madame Bovary?</span></li>
                <li>How do Emma's dreams of her perfect romantic environment contrast with her real &quot;dull countryside, imbecile petty bourgeois, life in its ordinariness&quot; environment?</li>

    <p>Now answer your own question, or another student's (see below), based on the <strong>whole</strong> story. In other words, how might we interpret the <span class="text">Metamorphosis</span> through the lens of Formalist, Marxist, Feminist&hellip; criticism? Think especially about the violin scene, the death scene and the final paragraph. </p>
    <p>For fun, <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~ljordan/metamorphosis/"> check out</a>: Which character are you in The Metamorphosis? </p>
    <p>&quot;We are all sentenced to solitary confinement inside our own skins, for life.&quot; Tennessee Williams. Recommended reading: two articles  relate to what I'll call <a href="222Isolationandcontact.html">The Gerasim Effect</a>&mdash;<span class="text">The United States holds tens of thousands of inmates in long-term solitary confinement. Is this torture?</span> by Atul Gawande  and <span class="text">Comforter and Comforted in an Unfolding Mystery</span> by Nell Burger Kirst. These articles could lead to a potential paper topic.</p>
<div class="maroon">
  <h3>FORMALIST CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How does the form of the story relate to its meaning?</li>
    <li>Why does the first sentence contain what could be described as the climax of the story?</li>
    <li>What is the significance of the &quot;monstrous vermin&quot; metaphor? What could it represent? What is its purpose?</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
    <h3>SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
<div class="red">
  <h4>Marxist Criticism:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>How does the father's failure at business affect Gregor's mindset in the beginning of the novella?</li>
    <li>What are the social statuses that Kafka relates to as sociological criticism?</li>
    <li>What social class does Gregor's family fall into and how does Gregor play a role in defining that class?</li>
    <li>How much of an impact does the Samsa family's financial situation play into the story?</li>
    <li>The longer Gregor is a vermin, how do his ideological values change? How do his goals in life change with regards to his family?</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
<div class="purple">
  <h4>Feminist Criticism: </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>If Gregor had a brother instead of a sister, would his brother have been responsible for caring for Gregor or was this simply her responsibility because she was a female?</li>
    <li>What dies Gregor's preoccupation with the photo of the woman in furs say about how he, and Kafka, view women during this period?</li>
    <li>How does the first half of the story depict the &quot;typical woman&quot; role in society and what characteristics are the women given?</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
<div class="teal">
  <h3>CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How does <em>Metamorphosis</em> reflect the period in which it was created?</li>
    <li>Some argue that <em>The Metamorphosis</em> portrays the soldier&rsquo;s feelings post World War I. &nbsp;How does Gregor&rsquo;s transformation and qualities directly pertain to the war and society&rsquo;s response to it?</li>
    <li>How might this story been affected if it was written in the present day as opposed to 1915? If the story were made in a movie then versus now, would the plot be diminished by the gory and severe special effects used in movies today or would it be enhanced? Also, if it was made into a movie, would that diminish the effect of creating your own mental image of Gregor as the vermin or enhance it?<strong></strong></li>
    <li>In Part I of <em>The Metamorphosis</em>, there is a focus on Gregor&rsquo;s job as a traveling salesman and the perception that people have about him based on this career; how does this reflect the culture of the time period? Can you think of a modern job that would raise the same concerns about a person?</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
<div class="orange">
  <h3>PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>From a Psychological standpoint, how would you explain his desire toward the lady with a fur coat and a boa in the frame that he is so attached to?</li>
    <li>How does Gregor's personality change after the metamorphosis and how does it stay the same?</li>
    <li>Gregor, after realizing his physical change and throughout <em>Metamorphosis</em>, undergoes social and psychological change as well. What are these changes and do you think these changes are reflections of what Kafka has experienced in his own life?</li>
    <li>How is each character coping with the transformation of Gregor's physical state?</li>
    <li>When Gregor changes into a monstrous vermin, what is the psychological state of the family and how does it change?</li>
    <li>What is the great psychological disconnect that Gregor is experiencing during this part of the story? Explain the conflict and provide examples.</li>
    <li>Is the behavior of the family in &ldquo;Metamorphosis&rdquo; after Gregor woke up as a vermin reflective of Kafka&rsquo;s personal relationship (or lack thereof) with his father? How?</li>
    <li>How does Gregor's perspective compare to what is going on around him?</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
<div class="blue">
  <h3>READER RESPONSE CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>While reading <em>Metamorphosis</em>, were there any instances in which you find yourself relating to Gregor or any of this family members?</li>
    <li>Do you think that the people's reactions were justified when they learned of Gregor's sudden alteration of human life to a monstrous vermin? Would you have reacted the same way as those around Gregor?</li>
    <li>Why is there no reason given for his transformation?</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
    <div class="green">
      <h3>ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Does the lack of setting identification and explanation of the environment affect the reader's comprehension of the story? Why or why not?</li>
        <li>How does Gregory's physical transformation mimic the claustrophobic environment he is bound to in the story?</li>
        <li>Why do you think that Kafka chose to transform Gregor into a vermin instead of some other creature or something else from nature? Would this work have the same effect if Kafka had not made Gregor a vermin and titled the story <em>Metamorphosis</em>?</li>
        <li>How did Gregory's metamorphosis change the world around him?</li>
        <li>How did Gregory's surroundings affect his life after the metamorphosis?</li>
      </ul>
</div>
    <div class="fuchsia">
      <h3>QUEER THEORY: </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>How does the way Gregor's family treats him after he becomes a vermin similar to the way family and friends react to someone after they admit to being homosexual? </li>
        <li>What object(s) in Gregor's apartment does he have a sensual attachment to?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

<h2><span class="class">Class 35 (Thesis exercise and Peer review of Term Paper) </span><span class="date">due Monday, April 7</span></h2>
<p>The first part of class will be devoted to <em>The Thesis Exercise</em>. Read the <a href="222Thesis exercise.html">web page</a> about how to write a thesis for a literary paper. Print and fill out the <a href="222Theses.html">page of sample FL 222 theses</a> where you rate the examples. The second half of class will be devoted to peer review of the first draft of your <a href="222Paper2010.html">Paper</a>. Print out <strong>two copies</strong> of the <a href="Peerevaluation2.pdf">Peer Review Feedback Form</a> to include with the <strong>two copies</strong> of your draft which you will bring for your classmates. Fill out the top part of the form with your name, paper title, and date. Do <strong>not wait</strong> until the last minute to print these materials out. Email me before class if you have an idea for your own original topic so that I can approve it. Speaking of original, a very creative paper where almost all the main characters meet in Hell written by a former student is featured <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~dsbeckma/To Hell with Literature.htm"> here</a>, and my favorite missing chapter of <em>Candide</em> is <a href="222VoltaireCandide.html">here</a>. </p>
<p>Selected writing advice from the <a href="222Paper2010.html">Term Paper page:</a></p>
<h3>Choose your topic</h3>
<p>Read through the topic choices below. Consult Chapter 10 in <span class="text"> A Short Guide, Writing about Fiction: the World of the Story</span>, especially the pages on &quot;Getting Ideas&quot; (171-5).  Which texts have been your favorite or challenged you the most? Send me an email or make an appointment if you need help deciding on a topic. <span class="red">If you are doing a creative project, you will not have a <strong>thesis </strong>per se in your rough draft, but you will replace that with a <strong>story premise </strong>that explains what the goal of your project is and how it relates to the text(s) you are responding to. </span></p>
<h3>Steps for writing </h3>
<p>Step 1: read, re-read and annotate your texts; write preliminary notes; build up to a fully formulated thesis. A thesis is a clear and specific argument, not a list, not an opinion, not an obvious fact.</p>
<p>See the <a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/course/FL/222">Library Tools</a> page to see resources available to you from NCSU libraries. </p>
<p>Step 2: Following <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>, Chapter 3; write a first draft of 1-2 pages about one of the topics below for the peer review session. It should have a working title and a fully formulated introduction (you can rewrite them later, but they need to be there for the draft) and several finished paragraphs; your audience knows the text, so you should avoid plot summaries. Use the present tense for literary analysis: Ivan <strong>is</strong> an ambitious&hellip; Flaubert <strong>reveals</strong>&hellip; Include your outline. This is the peer review draft version of your paper; print and bring 2 copies of it to class. Include the <a href="Peerevaluation2.pdf">Peer Review Feedback form</a> with each copy.</p>
<p>Some useful pages (among many) about writing:</p>
<ul>
  <li> For the difference between formal and informal style: <a href="http://www.mondofacto.com/study-skills/writing/how-to-use-academic-writing-style/04.html">http://www.mondofacto.com/study-skills/writing/how-to-use-academic-writing-style/04.html</a>.</li>
  <li>For guidelines about  commas, see <a href="http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/commas.html">http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/commas.html</a></li>
  <li>For writing anxiety or writer's block, see <a href="http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/writing_anxiety.html">http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/writing_anxiety.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. Beckman's hint about titles: A dull title sets expectations low. A good title invites the reader! Quotes, proverbs or aphorisms make great titles. Try a google search with a key word from your thesis (pride, satisfaction, quest, etc) and the word quote. I've already got a <a href="222Lovequotes.html">web page</a> with love quotes for you to use, since love is such a popular topic. </p>

  Fall 2009 </span></p>
<p class="style14">For each class, go directly to the <a href="222syfa09.html">Syllabus</a> to see  the reading assignment.</p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style7">Class 2: (Pope, Lecture 1)</span> <span class="style13">due Friday, August 21 </span><br />
  Read the argument (summary) and first stanza of Pope's <em>Essay on Man</em>. Write a page about the first stanza (lines 1-16) answering Shannon's 4 questions. <br />
  What is confusing?<br />
  What is repeated?<br />
  What is familiar?<br />
  What is strange?<br />
  <br />
  Print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222Enlightenment.html">The Enlightenment</a> and <a href="222GreatChain.html">The Great Chain of Being</a> </p>
<p class="style14">In addition, for this and the next assignment, take a look at  my web page on <a href="Explication.html"><em>Explication de Texte</em></a> and these web sites about figures of speech which are also listed on the handy <a href="222supmatf04.html">Supplementary Materials</a> page.<font color="#990000"><font color="#000000"> These pages will  be useful for your <a href="222poetrypresentation.html">Poetry Presentation</a> due</font></font><span class="style13"> Friday, September 11 </span><font color="#990000"><span class="style43"><font color="#000000">and </font></span></font><span class="style43"><span class="style13">Monday, September 14 </span></span><font color="#990000"><span class="style43"><font color="#000000"><br />

    This site contains figures of speech, thought, repetition, more than you can shake a stick at! Most examples are drawn from Shakespeare.  </font></span></font></p>

</a>This site is very cool because it has sound clips and draws from a wide range of speeches, movies, and more to illustrate the Figures of Speech. For example, see and listen to quotes from Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln, and Neil Armstrong on the page about antitheses: <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/figures/antithesis.htm">http://www.americanrhetoric.com/figures/antithesis.htm</a></p>
<p class="style1"><span class="style7">Class 3: (Pope, Lecture 2) </span><span class="style13">due Monday, August 24 <br />
      <span class="style4">1) Print out <a href="AcademicIntegrityPledge.html">Academic Integrity form</a>. Please sign, date  
        and turn it in. </span></span> <br />
    <br />
  2) Read <em>Essay on Man</em> and write a page about your stanza to turn in. In case you're not sure what a stanza is, you can look this and other literary terms up in our course <a href="222Glossary.html">Glossary</a> or your laminated <a href="http://www.barcharts.com/Inventory/Navision/9781572225886">Literary Terms Quick Study Guide</a>.</p>
<p class="style1"> Note that the Roman numerals I-X at the beginning of each stanza correspond to your assigned stanza number (not a page or line number). What is the stanza about? Give a one sentence summary. Answer the 4 questions from Shannon. Also, what are the key words and images in the stanza? How does the stanza connect with the ideas of the Enlightenment we've discussed? What is  the attitude of the narrator? What is the role of nature, especially animals, if any appear in your stanza?</p>
<p class="style1">3)<span class="style7"> <span class="style44">After reading Shannon Chapter 1, write your own definition of literature to turn in. Make it as short and complete as possible.</span></span> You can put it on the same sheet of paper as your discussion of your stanza. </p>
<p class="style1">4) Your first WebCT post is due at midnight on Monday. <br />
  Instructions: Login to <a href="http://vista.ncsu.edu/index.php">WebCT Vista</a>. <br />
  Do the Browser check and enable pop-up windows.<br />
  Enter your Unity ID and Password. <br />
  On your My Courses page, click on FL 222. <br />
  Click on Student Orientation to WebCT. Read Sections 1 and 5. <br />
  To see the first discussion assignment, go back to the Home Page and click on Discussion Topics.<br />
  Click on Introduction.<br />
  You will see the first topic, Introductory Post, by me. Read the assignment (Please introduce yourself to the rest of the class and tell us: if you could invite any three people, alive, dead or fictional, to dinner at your place, whom would you invite, why, and what would you serve?). Respond. </p>
<p class="style1">5) See the <a href="Type/ExtraCreditType.html">Extra Credit Assignment on <em>Myers-Briggs Type in College</em></a> I'm INFJ. If you have comments or questions about Myers-Briggs Type, feel free to share them as part of the introduction. You can do this assignment any time in the first month of classes. </p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style7">Class 4 (Voltaire, Lecture 1)</span> <span class="style13">due Wednesday, August 26 </span><br />
    <br />
1) Write a page about the first thirteen chapters of <em>Candide</em> answering Shannon's 4 questions. </p>
<p class="style14">2) Print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222ShortStoryNovel.html">Different Forms of Prose Fiction</a>; <a href="222SatireIronyUtopia.html">Satire, Irony and Utopia</a>. Read <a href="222Panglossian.htm">Panglossian</a>. </p>
<p class="style14">3) Consider bookmarking an online dictionary or two to make it easy to look up words you don't know. If you are doing the Reading Notebook, you can print out the definitions to include in your notebook. <br />
  <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/">http://dictionary.reference.com/</a><br />
  <a href="http://www.m-w.com/">http://www.m-w.com/</a></p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style4">4) I signed up for a new word-a day- email because they have such cool quotes: <a href="http://wordsmith.org/awad/subscribe.html">http://wordsmith.org/awad/subscribe.html</a><br />
If you need to build your vocabulary (taking the GRE?), it's a great way to learn about words. I am trying to figure out how to make it an extra credit opportunity. If you have any ideas, let me know. </span></p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style45">Class 5 (Voltaire, Lecture 2) <span class="style13">due Friday, August 28 </span><br />
      <span class="style4">Discuss the following questions after you do the reading assignment (Chapters 14-22). Is Eldorado a genuine utopia or (in one critic's words) &quot;a colossal bore&hellip;satirized by Voltaire as foolish and futile&quot;? </span></span><span class="style45"><span class="style4">Which specific behaviors or institutions show us that Voltaire wants the reader to see Eldorado as utopic?  <br />
  Does Voltaire have a philosophical lesson in mind or is it pure satire? Or both?</span></span> How does it correspond to your personal view of Utopia? <span class="style4">Quote from the text with examples to support your answers and include the page reference for each quotation.</span></p>
<p class="style14">See Lecture Notes on <a href="222dulce.html">Dulce et utile</a>.</p>
<p class="style14">The first original contribution post&mdash;on Pope&mdash;is due Friday at midnight. You will have many authors to choose from to do your required 13 posts (7 original contributions and 6 responses), but I encourage you to get in the habit of posting by starting with Pope or Voltaire. For an original contribution post, make a point or develop an argument of at least 7 lines based on something you read, learned or thought while reading <em>An Essay on Man</em>. It can be helpful to ask a question or make a provocative statement for your classmates to respond to. Did something in your homework get praise or a lot of comment from me? If so, it might be the basis of a good post. <br />
    <br />
  Read Shannon, Chapter 2. </p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style7">Class 6 (Voltaire, Lecture 3)</span> <span class="style13">due Monday, August 31 </span><br />
  Read the page in Supplementary Materials, <a href="Candide%20quotes.html">Quotes from different critics about &quot;Il faut cultiver notre jardin.&quot; </a><br />
  Write a page answering the following questions: what are some  literal and figurative meanings of the word <em>garden</em>? How do they apply here? How do <strong>you</strong> interpret the final line of the story? <br />
  <br />
  In order to understand the difference between  <strong>literal</strong> and <strong>figurative</strong>, here is an example I found online at <a href="http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm">http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm</a> : <br />
  <strong>literal</strong> vs. <strong>figurative</strong> meaning - relates to the meanings of words and phrases or expressions. For example, &quot;She was all ears&quot; has a <strong>figurative</strong> meaning (She was listening intently) as well as a <strong>literal</strong> meaning (Her body was composed of ears or she had a huge set of ears). </p>
<p class="style14">Read Shannon, Chapter 3. </p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style7">Class 7 (Romanticism; Pushkin, Lecture 1) </span><span class="style13">due Wednesday, September 2 <br />

    Response post on Pope due at midnight</span>.</p>
<p class="style14">A thought that just occured to me. If you are a slow reader or perfer to listen to a book, especially a long one like <em>Madame Bovary</em>, you might consider downloading an audiobook and getting a head start--be sure to get the unabridged version. One site: <a href="http://www.audible.com">http://www.audible.com</a> Let me know if this works for you. </p>

      <br />
  Here are two additional, more modern, sets of critical questions you may choose to address. They were written by a former student, Garry Pigg (Fall, 2005)</p>
<p class="style33">ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM </p>
<p class="style14">1. How do the environmental/ecological conditions within the setting of the work affect the language, mood, tone, and theme?<br />
  2. How does the use of the word &quot;nature&quot; in the work reflect the current scientific beliefs of the time and how does that affect the characters, plot, themes?<br />
  3. How does the relationship between man/woman and his/her environment--economically, agriculturally, botanically, socially--affect the characters, language, theme, plot, and tone? i.e. do the characters have to hunt and gather, farm, trade, live in city, country?<br />
  4. How do plants, animals, and their conditions in the environment affect the character's livelihood, the plot, the author's tone, the moods, the theme? i.e. the effects of individual species such as cows, camels, horses,goats, bananas, sugar, cotton, corn, potatoes, fungi, bacteria,<br />
  viruses; and ambient conditions such as drought, flooding, pollution, climate change, introduction of invasive species, and famine.</p>
<p class="style33">QUEER THEORY </p>
<p class="style14">1. How do the cultural feelings about sex affect the characters, plot, and themes?<br />
  2. How does sexual identity affect the characters? How do they deal with others and their own sexual deviance or breaking of social norms?<br />
  3. How does homosexuality or bisexuality play a role in the characters' lives, the tone, mood, theme, and plot of the work?<br />
  4. What role does sexuality play in the work?  How does it affect the use of language? Does it represent love and beauty or marriage and<br />
  reproduction?<br />
  5. How does religion affect the tendencies of the characters to express or not express themselves sexually?<br />
  6. How does the work represent sex and sexuality?  Does it use sexuality to define &quot;others&quot;? Does discussion of sex in the work hinder or help feminism?  Does it hurt or help racism, discrimination in general, and civil rights?  What is the connection between sexuality, race, gender, and social class in the work(s)?</p>

        <span class="style31"><span class="style32"><span class="style3"><strong>&bull; FORMALIST CRITICISM</strong></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="style3"><br />
- Why does Flaubert become the bias(ed) author when describing the thought process of the characters in his novel? That is, why are the thoughts of his characters subjective rather than objective? What purpose does this serve in terms of the overall structure of the novel?</span><span class="style20"><span class="style13"><span class="style4"><span class="style31"><span class="style32"><br />
</span></span></span></span></span><span class="style3">- How does Flaubert use physcial objects (windows, cigar cases, etc.) to show how Madame Bovary is feeling about her current situation?<br />
- What events, emotion, and/or feelings lead to Emma's instability in every facet of her life and ultimately cause her downfall?<br />
- How does Emma's nature of wanting life to be like a romantic novel have an impact on the novel's outcome?<br />
- What effect do Emma's nature and thoughts about life have on the plot of the story and why does her opinion on what life should be affect what she does throughout the novel?
</span><span class="style20"><span class="style13"><span class="style4"><span class="style31"><span class="style32"><br />
        <br />
        <strong>&bull; </strong></span></span><span class="style58">SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM<br />
    Marxist Criticism</span><span class="style32">: <br />
    -
    How do the class differences in <em>Madame Bovary</em> drive the story?<br />
    - How are the different levels of social class portrayed in Part 1, Chapter IV, The Wedding?  How do the descriptions of the guests&rsquo; attire depict which class they belong to?<br />
    - Throughout the story, Emma tends to indulge herself with things she can't afford just to make herself happy. Do you think Emma would have found happiness if she would have  grown up in an upperclass family with money to afford everything she wanted?<br />
    - How do the characters of <em>Madame Bovary</em> display a typical bourgeois lifestyle and in what ways does this tell us about Flaubert's view on the middle class during the mid-19th century?<br />
    - In 
    <em>Madame Bovary</em> there are obvious class differences bewteen the characters. How do these class differences support or reject the idea of socialism and social status that Flaubert is trying to portray?<br />
    - Consider the relationships between Abb&eacute; Bournisien and the other characters. Considering how the priest is initially introduced, portly and still greasy from his last meal, what kind of class commentary is being made using Bournisien? Remember Emma and Hippolyte. <br />
    <br />
    </span></span></span></span><span class="style101"><strong>Feminist Criticism:</strong></span><span class="style108"><br />
  - Many reasons in the story prevent Emma from carrying out her gender role, such as personality, settings and expectations. What do you think is the main reason for Emma rejecting her gender role? Is it her fantasies that are restraining her? Or do you think this is just another criticism by Flaubert of women not having enough freedom back in that time (freedom in not being allowed to &quot;dream&quot;; always expecting the typical)?<br />
  - In <em>Madame Bovary </em>the women seem to accept their roles. Why don't they rebel against this and how do they cope with the unfair female status?<br />
  - In Part III of <em>Madame Bovary, </em>Emma   gets into a great deal of financial trouble. Her excessive spending at the dry goods store caused to her to owe 8,000 francs. All thoughout the story, Emma complains of boredom. Is Flaubert suggesting the stereotype that women are frivolous is due to the fact that they have nothing to do other than spend money? Is he blaming women for this or is he blaming society for the position it puts women in?<br />
  - There seems to be some internal conflict on-going through the novel between Emma's feminine beauty and her wish to assert her dominance over her male counterparts. Is Flaubert making a case for or against women's equality? Emma clearly is no complete role model for women. However, does her dominance (attempted or successful) allow her to be seen as a hero for some women in the time period, or is Flaubert merely making fun of what he assumes is the fantastical and unrealistic mindset of women?<br />
  - Why is it that men are considered more free in society? Why are women devalued?<br />
  - In the book, all the Madame Bovarys are at times &quot;manly&quot; because they have a power over all the men they encounter. Women
  weren't usually depicted like this in Flaubert's time. Do you think this is how he wished they were looked at or how they acted? Give examples from the text. <br />
  - 
  Why does Emma Bovary like to dress in man-like clothes and wear men's glasses? What does this mean? <br />
  <br />
  </span><span class="style6"><strong>&bull;</strong> <strong>CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM</strong></span><br />
  <span class="style6">- What effect does social class and time period have on the morality of humans in 
  <em>Madame Bovary?<br />
  </em>- How did society react to Madame Bovary's relationship with her daughter when reading the story?<br />
  - What was the general understanding of mental illness during this time period?<br />
  - <em>Madame Bovary</em> (1857) was written during the Age of Realism. How are the themes of the age apparent in the text and what are the author's views on Romanticism based on examples from the text?<br />
  - How were the gender roles in <em>Madame Bovary</em> portrayed compared to cultural norms in the time period in which it was written?<br />
  <span class="style6">- How do the benefits of Emma's environment, not having to work, everything handed to her, affect the story and her relationship to others, in particular her relationship with Charles, Leon, and Rodophe?<br />
  - If the story were set in the modern day, most likely Emma wouldn't be taking care of all the finances going on between herself and Charles. How would this affect Lheureux's and Emma's plans? </span><br />
  - Taking the French Revolution (1789-1799) and the reign of Napoleon I into consideration, how do you think Flaubert's form and content in <em>Madame Bovary
</em>reflect the aftermath of the aforementioned historical times? Consider the collapse of the aristocracy, the rise of the middle class, Flaubert's status as a member of the educated elite, and Emma Bovary's status in society. Did Flaubert write </span><span class="style20"><span class="style13"><span class="style4"><span class="style6"><em>Madame Bovary</em></span></span></span></span><span class="style7"> to</span><span class="style6"> agree or disagree with this new middle class at the time?<br />
-Explain Flaubert's view of the middle class during the nineteenth century using examples from the text. <br />
</span><span class="style20"><span class="style13"><span class="style4"><span class="style32"><br />
  <span class="style91">&bull; 
    PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM<br />        
  </span><span class="style109">- How did Monsieur and Madame Bovary's parenting style affect Charles' psyche as an adult?<br />
  - How does the author use patterns or cycles to reveal characters' unconscious desires?<br />
  - What does the reader's reaction to the work say about his or her psychology?<br />
  - Flaubert was very critical of the bourgeoisie. How does Flaubert express his criticism of the bourgeoisie through the minds of the characters in<em> Madame Bovary?</em> </span></span></span></span></span><span class="style109">What point is Flaubert making to the reader by showing us what is going on in their minds?<br />
  - Given the romantic symbolism</span>
          <span class="style109">present within a realist script, what can the reader understand about the writer's psychological desires, whether conscious or unconscious?<br />
          - Flaubert said, &quot;I am Madame Bovary.&quot;  Flaubert was an indifferent student (like Charles), found the city distasteful (like Charles), never married, had an affair which upon ending left him with a loss of interest in romance, yet he suffered from venereal disease most of his life (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Flaubert), which indicates that he was promiscuous. [Related to his visits to prostitutes. Dr. B] Since Emma's character seems to mimic many of Flaubert's own personal characteristics, do you think Flaubert was relating to us his personal struggle with inner psychological demons?<br />
          - Why does he invent Berthe and Mme Rollet whose appearances are so few and far between?<br />
  - How does Emma's perception of her life and the end of the day (whether consciously or subconsciously) reflect the author's psychology about hope's presence in reality? Does the author's life up to the point he wrote the book reflect any of the characters' psychological motives and their outcomes?</span><br />  
  <span class="style109">- Emma is hysterical after losing the power of attorney. Why is she laughing after this upsetting event?<br />

  - How does Emma's behavior on her wedding night with Charles translate into her future affairs with other men?<br />
  -Why do you think Emma is promiscuous? Is it because she wants to act like a man?

The name of the complex derives from the Greek myth of Oedipus, who unwittingly kills his father Laius and marries his mother Jocasta.<br />
  <br />
        Freud considered the successful resolution of the Oedipus complex to be key to the development of gender roles and identity, with boys and girls resolving the conflicts differently as a result of castration anxiety and penis envy. Freud also held that the unsuccessful resolution of the Oedipus complex could result in neurosis and homosexuality.&hellip; Although common usage refers to 'suffering from an Oedipus complex', psychoanalysis does not consider the complex a pathology, but instead a perfectly normal stage that all children go through. Oedipal desires are thought to remain heavily repressed and unconsciously in the minds of all functioning adults.</span>&quot; <br />

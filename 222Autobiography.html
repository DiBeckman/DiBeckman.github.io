  <b>Elegy</b></font><br>
  In Greek and Roman literature, the term &#147;elegy&#148; was used to denote 
  any poem written in elegaic meter (alternating hexameter and pentameter lines)&#133; 
  especially complaints about love&#133;In the course of the seventeenth century, 
  however the terms began to be limited to its present usage: a formal and sustained 
  lament (and usually a consolation) for the death of a particular person. <br>
  <br>
  <font color="#FF0000"><b>Ode</b></font><br>
  An ode is a long, lyric poem, serious in subject, elevated in style and elaborate 
  in its stanzaic structure&#133; The irregular ode allows each stanza to establish 
  its own pattern of varying line lengths, number of lines and rhyme scheme. This 
  type has been the most common for the English Ode; Wordsworth&#146;s great &#147;Ode: 
  Intimations of Immortality&#148; is representative&#133; Romantic poets preferred 
  the personal ode of description and passionate meditation, which is stimulated 
  by an aspect of the outer scene and turns on the attempt to solve either a private 
  problem or a generally human one.<br>

  <font color="#FF0000"><b>Pathetic Fallacy</b></font>: &quot;A phrase originated 
  by Ruskin in <i>Modern Painters</i>, Vol. III, Part IV (1856) to describe the 
  attribution of human characteristics to inanimate objects. Such an attribution 
  usually falls short of a full personification. Quoting a phrase from Kinglsey, 
  &quot;the cruel, crawling foam,&quot; Ruskin said, &quot;The foam is not cruel, 
  not does it crawl&#133;All violent feelings&#133;produce in use a falseness 
  in all our impressions of external things, which I would characterize as the 
  'Pathetic Fallacy'. &quot;<br>
  <br>
  Ruskin qualified his condemnation by admitting that examples of the pathetic 
  fallacy, though false to nature, were often were beautiful. This phenomenon, 
  he argued, was usually found in poets whom he placed in the second rank (such 
  as Wordsworth, Coleridge, Tennyson) whose who felt strongly but thought weakly. 
  Great poets, who both felt and thought strongly, would not so distort nature 
  unless, under the stress of prophetic inspiration, they were attempting to express 
  something so incomparably above them that no human mind could perceive it truly. 
  Though this distinction in the use of the pathetic fallacy has been criticized 
  as dubiously subjective, Ruskin's term has remained useful. Today, however, 
  it is descriptive and carries no pejorative connotations.&quot; <br>

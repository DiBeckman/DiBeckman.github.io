<p><strong>The Great Piece of Turf</strong> by Rita Dove<br />
  (after Albrecht Dürer's <em>Das Grosse Rasenstuck</em>, 1503)<br />
  <br />
  Dug out just before sunrise,<br />
  still moist where the roadside dips<br />
  into a hollow, each common<br />
closed blossom:</p>
<p>plantain, heath rush,<br />
  feathered shoot of yarrow,<br />
  creepy Charlie, cock's foot<br />
and a dandelion.</p>
<p>What possessed him<br />
  to tote it<br />
  home? And why<br />
  whenever I see this watercolor—</p>
<p>its charms held lightly<br />
  in check, lightly allowed<br />
  to carouse—do I see<br />
  charcoal bones on a horse</p>
<p>croaking &quot;memento mori?&quot;<br />
  <em>For in truth, art is <br />
  implicit in nature, and<br />
  whoever can extract it, has it.</em></p>
<p>Each blade of meadow<br />
  poises discrete<br />
  in its moment, abstract.<br />
  What road</p>
<p>could I be walking on,<br />
  fresh with weeds and<br />
  the gnarled insistent<br />
  wildflower? Nature holds<br />
  a knife to my throat<br />
  by the sweating canal.<br />
  I want my piece of earth<br />
  on a white cloth,</p>
<p>a block excised<br />
  from the living lap<br />
  and set before me to mourn:<br />
  magnificent edifice</p>
<p>dying before the very eye. . .</p>

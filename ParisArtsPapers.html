<p class="style2">Paris Arts Papers </p>
<p class="style1">Ideally, you will come up with your own paper topic--some aspect of French society, history, or culture that interests you and that you can explore in some singnificant way in Paris. <a href="ParisArtsPaperTopics.html">Here</a> are some ideas that Dr. B has come across while preparing this class that might help you find a topic. Cindy Levine, the Humanities Reference Librarian at DH Hill (see Library Tools), is happy to help you find some good resources once you've narrowed down the topic: Email her at <a href="mailto:cindy_levine@ncsu.edu">cindy_levine@ncsu.edu</a> to set up an appointment. </p>
<p class="style1">Your paper will be due on <strong>Sunday, April 25</strong>. Our final class meeting will include presentations of your final research projects. See also: <a href="StudyAbrodScoring Rubric.html">Scoring Rubric </a></p>
<p class="style8">Writing guidelines from Dr G:<br />
The research paper for this seminar is to be 15 pages including footnotes and illustrations, but not the appendices. We are also open to the idea that you might want to make a film, create a web site, or take another creative approach to this project. </p>
<p class="style8">If you are studying a particular individual, you might want to check out Nigel Hamilton&rsquo;s  HOW TO DO BIOGRAPHY:  A PRIMER, published by Harvard University Press in 2008.  Also, Vasari&rsquo;s  LIVES OF THE ARTISTS first published in 1550.  It&rsquo;s the beginnings of artistic biography.  Also you might want to consult the ART INDEX as a database to see what has been written about your artist and/or work of art. </p>
<p class="style8">What question about the artist and his/her work(s) are you asking?  Be sure to have the subject narrowed down so that you can do a thorough analysis (See Drs. Beckman and Gustke to make sure your focus is narrow enough).  You will need to ask yourself where you are going to start?  While this may seem obvious, it is not.  You don&rsquo;t have time to write a biography so it will be a portion of the artist&rsquo;s life, or an analysis of one piece of art.  You must provide the details certainly as with a painting, for example, title, size, medium, artist, when painted, title, where it now resides and its provenance.  Then you need to state your question (birthing your subject so to speak in Hamilton&rsquo;s words), and you will also have to figure out how it will end.  You will need to place the artist/work in historical context, and draw some conclusions to finish your work. </p>
<p class="style8">Some technical items:  Be sure your pages are numbered (although the page number should not appear on the cover sheet or first page).  You should have a cover page and a table of contents and a list of illustrations if needed.  Please use footnotes (preferred) or endnotes.  Follow the <a href="http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home">CHICAGO MANUAL OF STYLE</a> (see the Quick Guide) for the proper citation information.  Under no circumstances are you to use parenthetical citations.  You do not need to include a bibliography since you will have footnotes.  The paper is to be typed, double spaced.  Do not put extra spaces between paragraphs.  Please indent your paragraphs five spaces (one tab).  Ten or 12 point type only, but I am open to a font other than Times Roman. (Dr. B likes Verdana, Dr. G prefers Book Antiqua.) </p>
<p class="style8">For your class presentation, you will have five-six minutes to present your research.  While I do not expect this to be a formal, dress/suit and tie, type of presentation, I do expect it to be well prepared and thoughtfully presented.  You might want to make a simple one-page handout for the class that provides a brief outline of your project along with contact information if someone has additional questions.  I expect these to be interactive and that you, as classmates, will be asking questions of the presenter about his/her research. </p>
<p class="style8">Writing Advice:  Below are comments from some of my former professors at the University of New Hampshire on writing history research papers that should prove helpful:</p>
<p class="style8">From Professor Allen Linden with some additions:  You should be able to blend what you have learned from your reading with your evaluation of what you have learned.  In other words, you should present an informed opinion in your work.</p>
<p class="style8">In the introduction of your paper, usually the first paragraph, you should state the question or questions you are answering.  In the body of the paper you must provide the evidence drawn from your reading and research on which you base your conclusions.  You must cite evidence and explain IN YOUR OWN WORDS how the evidence supports your conclusions.  Copying a series of quotations from books or articles is NOT enough.  You must explain how these quotations contribute to your answer.  In other words, you must explain to the reader of your report or paper your conclusions and why you think those conclusions are reliable.  You should end with the conclusions drawn from your research.</p>
<p class="style8">One of the keys to good writing is REWRITING.</p>
<p class="style8">Let me (Dr. G) add here:  Please give yourself time to EDIT or what I prefer to call fine-tuning.  It is when you go back and check to make sure you have not said the same thing more than once.  It is looking for a better/clearer way to say something you feel is an important point.  It is looking for the best word (for example when Paine chooses &ldquo;devour&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;eat&rdquo; to describe the actions of America&rsquo;s &ldquo;mother&rdquo; country), and fixing grammatical mistakes.  It is rereading to make sure you are &ldquo;spot on&rdquo; i.e., following the point you said was the focus of your paper.  Put extra material in a footnote, but make sure the paper itself is easy to follow, and you do not get off topic.  This is what will make your paper a polished piece of writing.</p>
<p class="style8">From Professor Charles E. Clark (former newspaper man), again with some additions:  A research paper, like any piece of expository writing, ought to have a definite shape to it, a design.  It should have a beginning, a middle, and an end; and the middle should have a discernible number of parts that fit together somehow.  There should be a thread of consistency throughout, a theme or line of thought or structured argument that leads the reader logically and clearly from one part to the next, from beginning to end.  All the pieces of the essay should contribute to the author&rsquo;s central purpose.  Cut out all fat, all useless diversions, as you edit and revise.  (Dr G:  some information can go in the footnotes if you think it is too important to lose.)  Shape your paper into a coherent whole.  Make the pieces fit together tightly.  You ought to have some idea of the fundamental design of the piece before you start writing, and you ought to stick to it as much as you can even as you leave room to explore and discover along the way.</p>
<p class="style8">One draft is almost never enough to give you the results you want.  Professional writers usually work their way to the finished product through many drafts, whether the revision is done as the first draft progresses or whether it is done after the first draft is finished without pause for corrections.  In fact, the real writing, the real craftsmanship, more often than not takes place as you revise, reorganize, and tinker.  Do not be reluctant to edit, reorganize, and rewrite&mdash;and rewrite again.  That is the way the best writers do it, and it is the way you ought to do it.  Writing something down, even something you know is a long way from the final version, is an infinitely bigger step ahead than sitting around waiting for inspiration.  The &ldquo;inspiration,&rdquo; if that is what it is, will come as you work it through on paper. </p>
<p class="style8">Be wary of quotations, especially long ones.  Sometimes we want to use the exact language of a source to convey the flavor of a time and place, or the exact language of an author to provide a text to use as a point of departure.  These are good reasons to use direct quotations.  Many students, especially beginning ones, overdo it.  It is difficult and sometimes awkward to integrate somebody else&rsquo;s language into our own, and lengthy quotations have a habit of drifting away from the point immediately at hand, becoming only marginally relevant to our argument.  Besides, they bore the reader.  Therefore, never use a quotation when it is possible to paraphrase, or when you can just as readily use an author&rsquo;s facts or ideas in a sentence or paragraph of your own without using his/her actual words.  When you do resort to quotations, do it as rarely as possible and prefer short passages&mdash;even snatches&mdash;to long ones.  And you must almost never end a piece of writing with a quotation.  It is you, not someone else, who ought to have the last word.</p>
<p class="style8">Let me (Dr. G) add:  Remember I prefer quotes over four lines long to be indented and single spaced (see below).  Also, please check to make sure you are quoting exactly.  Students often leave out words, not on purpose, but just because of sloppy copying, which changes the entire meaning of the quote.  It is very frustrating for the reader (moi in this case), who must then try and figure out where the mistake is, and what point you are really trying to get across to the reader.</p>
<p class="style8">AND SOME FINAL NOTES FROM YOUR PROFESSOR:<br />
  &bull;	Book titles, journals, names of ships, titles of songs, and art works are italicized, or underlined.  Chapter titles and articles are in quotation marks.<br />
  &bull;	A paragraph MUST (with a few qualified exceptions) have a least three sentences.<br />
  &bull;	Do not use contractions in a formal paper unless they are part of a quote.<br />
  &bull;	Its (possessive), it&rsquo;s (contraction of it is)&mdash;so, of course, you will not use it in your paper.<br />
  &bull;	Their (possessive), there (that place), they&rsquo;re (contraction of they are)&mdash;so you will not use this in your paper either.<br />
  &bull;	1800s not 1800&rsquo;s<br />
  &bull;	Cannot is one word<br />
  &bull;	As noted above, quotes over four lines long should be indented and single spaced.  You then do not use quotation marks.  For example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style8">If this is a long quote, it should be indented and single spaced.  Quotation marks are not necessary.  You will have a footnote at the end of the quotation for reference.  By indenting and single spacing the quote, you have visually helped your reader identify what words are not yours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style8">&bull;	All right it two words.  There is no such word as &ldquo;alright&rdquo; even though advertisers use it and some computer programs spellers do not catch it.  You would not write alwrong so don&rsquo;t write alright!!<br />
&bull;	A dash is two hyphens together--with no spaces on either side.  Your computer program may have the ability to insert a dash&mdash;please do so if this is a possibility.  If you use a hyphen, your reader thinks the two words are connected.  (In Microsoft Word 2007, if you type in the two dashes with no space on either side, it will automatically substitute the dash.)</p>
<p class="style8">Note bene:<br />
Please see me, call me, and or e-mail me if you have any questions or I can be of help in any way.  I would like to discuss your paper topic with each of you individually even it is still in the preliminary stages, prior to spring break.  I will be happy to look at a draft of your paper as you progress with your writing.</p>

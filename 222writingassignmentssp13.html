  <h2 class="class">Class 2 (Pope, Lecture 1) <span class="date">due Wednesday, January 9</span></h2>
  <p> Complete your <a href="222Morereflections.pdf">More Reflections</a> form to turn in.</p>
  <p>Read the argument (summary) and first stanza of Pope's <span class="text">Essay on Man</span>. Write a page about the first stanza (lines 1-16) answering Shannon's 4 questions*.</p>
  <ol class="unspaced">
    <li>What is confusing?</li>
    <li>What is repeated?</li>
    <li>What is familiar?</li>
    <li>What is strange?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>*This and all subsequent references to Shannon are from Edward Shannon's <span class="text">The Prentice Hall Guide to Writing about Literature</span> (Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2002) which went out of print in 2010. I  replaced it with <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> as a textbook for our class. Details about what he means by &quot;confusing, repeated, familiar and strange&quot; can be found <a href="222Shannonmore.html">here</a>.</p>
  <p>Write a one-paragraph to one-page summary of Chapter 1 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>. Include the title of each chapter in your heading, since   it should reflect the main point of the chapter. Your summary should include the main points and any others that seem especially helpful or surprising to you. Some students prefer to an outline format or question format. (See <a href="222ShortGuideSample.pdf">this example</a> of a question format.) Outlining, writing questions, and summarizing are all useful skills. You may handwrite or type it, and you may include it on the same page with your discussion of the first stanza of <span class="text">Essay on Man.</span> Unlike the literature assignments, you may submit<span class="text"> A Short Guide</span> assignments electronically since I will not make extensive comments on them. If they are submitted electronically, they will be returned to you electronically. </p>
  <p> Print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222Enlightenment.html">The Enlightenment</a> and <a href="222GreatChain.html">The Great Chain of Being</a> if you want to use them to take notes.  </p>
<p>In addition, for this and the next assignment, take a look at  my web page on <a href="Explication.html"><em>Explication de Texte</em></a> and these web sites about figures of speech which are also listed on the handy <a href="222supmatf04.html">Supplementary Materials</a> page. These pages will  be useful for your <a href="222poetrypresentation.html">Poetry Presentation</a> due on <span class="date">January 30</span> and <span class="date">February 1</span>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Here is <a href="http://grammar.about.com/od/terms/a/revquiz20terms.htm?p=1">a quiz</a> you can take to assess your knowledge of the &quot;Top 20 figures of speech&quot; by Richard Norquist.</li>
    <li> <a href="http://www.nipissingu.ca/faculty/williams/figofspe.htm">This site</a> contains figures of speech, thought, repetition, more than you can shake a stick at! Most examples are drawn from Shakespeare. </li>
    <li> <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/rhetoricaldevicesinsound.htm">This site</a> is very cool because it has sound clips and draws from a wide range of speeches, movies, and more to illustrate the Figures of Speech. For example, see and listen to quotes from Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln, and Neil Armstrong on <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/figures/antithesis.htm">the page about antitheses</a>.</li>
    <li>If you are a sci-fi fan, check out this <a href="http://io9.com/5930325/10-literary-devices-and-where-you-can-find-them-in-science-fiction?utm_source=io9+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=52381cfe6f-UA-142218-29&amp;utm_medium=email">Blog post</a>.</li>

<h2 class="class">Class 3 (Pope, Lecture 2) <span class="date">due Friday, January 11</span></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Read <span class="text">Essay on Man</span> and write a page about your stanza to turn in. In case you're not sure what a <em>stanza</em> is, you can look this and other literary terms up in our course <a href="222Glossary.html">Glossary</a>, the Glossary in Appendix B of <span class="text">A Short Guide to Writing About Literature</span>, or a web site such as <a href="http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms.html">http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms.html</a>. <br />
      <br />
Note that the Roman numerals I-X at the beginning of each stanza correspond to your assigned stanza number (not a page or line number). What is the stanza about? Give a one-sentence summary. Answer  Shannon's 4 questions. Also, what are the key words and images in the stanza? How does the stanza connect with the ideas of the Enlightenment we've discussed? What is  the attitude of the narrator? What is the role of nature, especially animals, if any appear in your stanza?</li>
    <li>Write a one-paragraph to one-page summary or outline of Chapter 2 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> to turn in. Take, correct, and turn in your answers to the Quiz in Appendix B  364-371 of <span class="text">A Short Guide.</span></li>

      <h2 class="class">Class 4 (Voltaire, Lecture 1) <span class="date"> due Monday, January 14</span></h2>
      <ol class="spaced">
        <li> Read/print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222ShortStoryNovel.html">Different Forms of Prose Fiction</a>; <a href="222SatireIronyUtopia.html">Satire, Irony and Utopia</a>. Read <a href="222Panglossian.htm">Panglossian</a>. </li>

        <li>Consider bookmarking an online dictionary, such as <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/">dictionary.com</a> or <a href="http://www.m-w.com/">Merriam-Webster</a> to make it easy to look up words you don't know. If you are doing the Reading Notebook, you can print out the definitions to include in your notebook. Do you like words or want to improve your vocabulary (GRE in your future?)? I recommend that you sign up for the free daily email from  Anu Gang <a href="http://wordsmith.org/awad/subscribe.html">A Word a Day</a>.</li>
     </ol>
<h2 class="class">Class 5 (Voltaire, Lecture 2) <span class="date">due Wednesday, January 16</span></h2>
<ul><li> Discuss the following questions after you do the reading assignment (Chapters 14-22). Quote from the text with examples to support your answers and include the page reference for each quotation.
          <ul>
            <li>Is Eldorado a genuine utopia or (in one critic's words) &quot;a colossal bore&hellip;satirized by Voltaire as foolish and futile&quot;?</li>
            <li>Which specific behaviors or institutions show us that Voltaire wants the reader to see Eldorado as utopic?</li>
            <li>Does Voltaire have a philosophical lesson in mind or is it pure satire? Or both?</li>
            <li>How does it correspond to your personal view of Utopia?</li></ul>
        </li>
</ul>
<ul><li>See Lecture Notes on <a href="222dulce.html">Dulce et utile</a>.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Read Chapter 3 in <em>A Short Guide</em> and write a summary to turn in.</li></ul>
 <ul><li>The first original contribution post&mdash;on Pope&mdash;is due <span class="date">tonight</span> at midnight. You will have many authors to choose from to do your required 14 posts (7 original contributions and 7 responses), but I encourage you to get in the habit of posting by starting with Pope or Voltaire. For an original contribution post, make a point or develop an argument of at least one  full paragraph (5-8 sentences) based on something you read, learned or thought while reading <em>An Essay on Man</em>. Ask a question or make a provocative statement for your classmates to respond to. You may also include a quote from the text under discussion or links to other web sites. Did something in your homework get praise or a lot of comment from me? If so, it might be the basis of a good post.</li></ul>
          <h2><span class="class">Class 6 (Voltaire, Lecture 3)</span> <span class="date">due Friday, January 18</span></h2>
          <p>Read the page in Supplementary Materials, <a href="Candide%20quotes.html">Quotes from different critics about &quot;Il faut cultiver notre jardin.&quot;</a> Write a page which includes answers to the following questions: what are some  literal and figurative meanings of the word <em>garden</em>? How do they apply to Candide's garden? How do <strong>you</strong> interpret the final line of the story? </p>
          <p>To help you to understand the difference between <strong>literal</strong> and <strong>figurative</strong>, here is  an example I found online:</p>
<blockquote>
            <p><strong>literal</strong> vs. <strong>figurative</strong> meaning - relates to the meanings of words and phrases or expressions. For example, &quot;She was all ears&quot; has a <strong>figurative</strong> meaning (She was listening intently) as well as a <strong>literal</strong> meaning (Her body was composed of ears or she had a huge set of ears). <span class="citation"><a href="http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm">Literary Terms for English</a></span></p>

How did it entertain and instruct? What figures of speech or rhetoric were used? Any literary allusions? What was repeated and familiar? (Ideally, not too much will be strange or confusing.)

<h2><span class="class">Class 16 (Flaubert 5) </span><span class="date">due Wednesday, February 13</span></h2>
<p>Finish reading <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> 1215-1249.</p>
<p>Writing assignments:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Finish your character sketch to turn in. What happens to your character(s) in Book III? </li>
  <li>Choose any one of the following questions to answer and include the question with your answer. These questions would also inspire some good discussions in your Moodle posts.</li>
  <div class="maroon">
    <h3>FORMALIST CRITICISM:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Flaubert changes the tempo of <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> by describing certain events in great detail, others are briefly told. How does the form of <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> reflect this?</li>
      <li>How does the 
        binary opposition between Emma and Charles reenforce the moral of <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span>?</li>
      <li>Power is frequently defined as the ability to influence the behavior of people with or without resistance, as well as to act or say something in a certain way. In Flaubert's novel, is there a character that lacks this power? If so, describe both the character and how this loss of power affects this character throughout the story</li>
      <li>What purpose does the intense and detailed descriptions serve? How does it reinforce and/or add meaning to the story?</li>
      <li>How much would these characters be changed, if  at all, if they were written by a Romantic author? Would the plot of the story be different or could Flaubert be closely related to a writer like Voltaire?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h3>SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
  <div class="red">
    <h4>Marxist Criticism:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Is Emma solely responsible for her problem, or is she a victim of society? Is it easy to sympathize with her? Why or why not?</li>
      <li>What do Lheureux's actions say about the Capitalist economic system, and what does Emma and Charles' response to his actions show about Capitalism's effects on society?</li>
      <li>Marxism is the social policies and principles proposed by Karl Marx around the time when Flaubert wrote <em>Madame Bovary</em>. What was the social status of women in this story?  More specifically, how do men seem to shape and impact the lives of the women they are around; especially Emma?</li>
      <li>What character epitomizes Flaubert's view on society and wordly objects, or his dislike of class separation and the bourgeoisie?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="purple">
    <h4>Feminist Criticism: </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Is Emma's assertion of her feminine autonomy an expression of a desire to be free from repression, or a show of typically perceived &quot;feminine hysteria&quot; culminating in her demise?</li>
      <li>Do Emma's flawed romantic ideals come from being a woman in a male-dominated society? In other words, if Emma were born a man would she  be able to live out her dreams instead of having to repress them for society's sake?</li>
      <li>Does the author, Flaubert, depict Emma's personality as a harsh human being because of her gender?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="teal">
    <h3>CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>How do Emma's fantasies of a cheating wife tell us about the cultural and historical references of the time? </li>
      <li>What historical events influenced Flaubert's life and led to an influence in his writing of <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span>? For example, why was he so against the middle-class and their values?</li>
      <li>Is the character Emma  a Romantic character or is she a Realistic character with Romantic hopes and dreams?</li>
      <li>How would responses to this story differ if it were written in a modern day context? What if everything stayed the same but it was only written and released in the 2000s? Do you think that looking at it from these viewpoints help you understand better the context it was written in and the importance? </li>
      <li>How does Flaubert's detailing of the different social classes Madame Bovary is a part of reflect his personal view of each?</li>
      <li>How do the descriptions of not only characters and the scenes in Madame Bovary reflect the time period?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="orange">
    <h3>PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What does Flaubert's portrayal of Emma's depression and discontent with her husband illustrate about the author's personality?</li>
      <li>What do Emma's emotions and behaviors reveal about her psychological state? Do you think that she let her materialistic needs and desire for romanticism lead to a split personality?</li>
      <li>Emma is obsessed with what she thinks she wants, and is permanently dissatisfied with what she has. This is a hallmark of traditional Freudian narcissism: an obsession with the self, but a complete lack of knowledge of self. Emma wants to be happy at the expense of actual happiness or the happiness of those around her. Q. Does Emma's lack of self-knowledge and obsession with her own happiness lead her to depression and the suffering of those around her? </li>
      <li>Do you think that Emma's character was meant to raise awareness of bipolar disorder at this time?  Could Flaubert have been on to something that was beyond his time?</li>
      <li>Do you think Flaubert used Emma's character to reveal some of truth about his life or fantasies? </li>
      <li> How does Emma's mental state reveal about her personalities and behaviors? </li>
      <li>How do Emma's unrealistic dreams of romance lead to her suicide?</li>
      <li> Do you think Emma is capable of real love and romance or do these only exist in her fantasized romantic world (given the fact that Emma is psychologically unstable)?</li>
      <li>It says that the elder Madame Bovary was &quot;rejoicing inwardly at the thought of recapturing [Charles'] affection&quot; when Emma died. What does this say about how the author views mothers? </li>
      <li>Could Emma's episodes of grandeur of Eros love be the product of a variance of an depersonalizing disorder caused by depression? Or could it be the product of a midlife crisis? Why or Why not? Use evidential support from <em>Madame Bovary</em> to support your answer.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="blue">
    <h3>READER RESPONSE CRITICISM:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Can you see yourself living during this time period? What are some aspects of life you can see yourself doing/not doing during this time?</li>
      <li>Do you find this more of a tragedy or a satire? How does this shape your response to the events in <em>Madame Bovary</em>?</li>
      <li>When reading <em>Madame Bovary</em>, which character do you empathize with the most?  Can you relate to them?  Do you feel bad for them?  Explain why you empathize with this character. </li>
      <li>Many writings reflect the current happenings of a time. We know that <em>Madame Bovary </em>is making fun of romantic ideals; instead, it displays a more realist approach. At the time this writing was published, do you think many people could relate to this story (as far as infidelity, drama or characters go), or is this just a juicy story that catches attention? If it does relate to the public, how does it do so?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="green">
    <h3>ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
    <ul><li>On page 1041 Flaubert writes, &quot;The stream, which makes this part of Rouen a kind of squalid little Venice, flowed just below, stained yellow, purple or blue between its bridge and railings&quot;. How does Flaubert use imagery to show the affects of industrialization on nature in this literary work? Do you believe Flaubert has a negative opinion about the impacts on nature by mankind?</li>
      <li>What roles do flowers and plants play in reflecting the inner conflicts of the characters?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="fuchsia">
    <h3>QUEER THEORY: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Would you agree that this novel contains an immense amount of sexuality? If so, would you agree or consider the fact that Emma may have a serious issue psychologically due to her personal and constant desires and needs for satisfaction in life through men and sex? (She really shows a never-ending dissatisfaction with her life; she constantly needs attention, luxurious items, men, sex, to feel good, to be accepted, to be rich, to be famous, to have the world at the palm of her hand, and so on.) Would you then agree that she may be narcissistic and may be infatuated with herself suggesting homosexuality?</li>
      <li>Does heterosexuality necessarily lead to unhappiness? </li>
      <li>What are the material and psychic conditions that lead a middle-class woman to find heterosexual marriage so unfulfilling?</li>
      <li>Does compulsory heterosexuality inhibit some more polymorphous desire from being gratified?</li>
    </ul>

                  <h2><span class="class">Class 35 (Thesis exercise and Peer review of Term Paper) </span><span class="date">due Monday, April 8</span></h2>
                  <p>The first part of class will be devoted to <em>The Thesis Exercise</em>. Read the <a href="222Thesis exercise.html">web page</a> about how to write a thesis for a literary paper. Print and fill out the <a href="222Theses.html">page of sample FL 222 theses</a> where you rate the examples. The second half of class will be devoted to peer review of the first draft of your <a href="222Paper2010.html">Paper</a>. Print out <strong>two copies</strong> of the <a href="Peerevaluation2.pdf">Peer Review Feedback Form</a> to include with the <strong>two copies</strong> of your draft which you will bring for your classmates. Fill out the top part of the form with your name, paper title, and date. Do <strong>not wait</strong> until the last minute to print these materials out. Email me before class if you have an idea for your own original topic so that I can approve it. Speaking of original, a very creative paper where almost all the main characters meet in Hell written by a former student is featured <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~dsbeckma/To Hell with Literature.htm"> here</a>, and my favorite missing chapter of <em>Candide</em> is <a href="222VoltaireCandide.html">here</a>. </p>
                  <p>Selected writing advice from the <a href="222Paper2010.html">Term Paper page:</a></p>
                  <h3>Choose your topic</h3>
                  <p>Read through the topic choices below. Consult Chapter 10 in <span class="text"> A Short Guide, Writing about Fiction: the World of the Story</span>, especially the pages on &quot;Getting Ideas&quot; (171-5).  Which texts have been your favorite or challenged you the most? Send me an email or make an appointment if you need help deciding on a topic. <span class="red">If you are doing a creative project, you will not have a <strong>thesis </strong>per se in your rough draft, but you will replace that with a <strong>story premise </strong>that explains what the goal of your project is and how it relates to the text(s) you are responding to. </span></p>
                  <h3>Steps for writing </h3>
                  <p>Step 1: read, re-read and annotate your texts; write preliminary notes; build up to a fully formulated thesis. A thesis is a clear and specific argument, not a list, not an opinion, not an obvious fact.</p>
                  <p>See the <a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/course/FL/222">Library Tools</a> page to see resources available to you from NCSU libraries. </p>
                  <p>Step 2: Following <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>, Chapter 3; write a first draft of 1-2 pages about one of the topics below for the peer review session. It should have a working title and a fully formulated introduction (you can rewrite them later, but they need to be there for the draft) and several finished paragraphs; your audience knows the text, so you should avoid plot summaries. Use the present tense for literary analysis: Ivan <strong>is</strong> an ambitious&hellip; Flaubert <strong>reveals</strong>&hellip; Include your outline. This is the peer review draft version of your paper; print and bring 2 copies of it to class. Include the <a href="Peerevaluation2.pdf">Peer Review Feedback form</a> with each copy.</p>
                  <p>Some useful pages (among many) about writing:</p>

                  </ul>
                  <p>Dr. Beckman's hint about titles: A dull title sets expectations low. A good title invites the reader! Quotes, proverbs or aphorisms make great titles. Try a google search with a key word from your thesis (pride, satisfaction, quest, etc) and the word quote. I've already got a <a href="222Lovequotes.html">web page</a> with love quotes for you to use, since love is such a popular topic. </p>

                  <ol>
                    <li> Who is Judith Shakespeare? Why does Woolf create her? What is the message about women and women writers that Woolf suggests by telling Judith's story? Is Judith fact, fiction, truth, a lie?</li>
                    <li> Choose any work we've read so far and speculate about how it might have been different if the work had been written by a woman rather than a man. (There is no right or wrong answer: let your imagination take you somewhere. Would the characters be different? The plot? The ending? How does the author's gender impact his or her art?)</li>

 <h2><span class="class">Class 38 (Paper Full Draft)</span><span class="date"> due Monday, April 15</span></h2>
                  <p>No class meeting, but  come to the classroom to drop off the complete draft of your paper along with your peer review drafts. See the <a href="222Paper2010.html">Paper</a> page for full details.</p>
                  <p>Highlights  include:</p>
                  <p>-Step 3: Reflect on your peer reviewers' suggestions and write a full draft of your paper to turn in to me. Proofread following the <span class="text">Editing</span> and other checklists listed on the inside cover of <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>. I will not grade the paper at this point but will return it to you with comments, so that you can write the final draft. If you are doing a creative project, be sure you have included both the creative section and the critical or artist's journal section. Consult the <a href="222scoringrubric.html">Scoring Rubric for Papers</a>, <a href="222scoringrubric-rewrite.html">Scoring Rubric for Creative Paper</a>, and <a href="222scoringrubriccreativeart.html">Scoring Rubric for Creative Art Projects</a> so that you'll know what I will be looking for when I do grade the paper.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Chapter 14 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> is an exellent presentation of the style and format I expect in  a literary paper. Pay attention to good organization and logical transitions between paragraphs.</li>
                    <li>Base your arguments on close readings of the texts you have chosen.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Two areas that are normally weak in the first draft are the use of quotations and the conclusion.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Give concrete examples (quotes) from 
                      the texts to support your arguments, but not to fill up space.  These quotations are the evidence you need to provide to prove your thesis. You will usually use at least one in each of body paragraphs.</li>
                    <li>In order to integrate quotes appropriately, first introduce the quote by making the point, connected to your thesis, that the passage illustrates. Next, include the quote, usually 3-5 lines of text. Finally, tie the quote back into your argument with a concluding sentence in your own words: &quot;&hellip;remind your reader that these passages are there to prove a point. End your discussion on your words, not theirs.&quot; (Shannon, 162-3).</li>
                  </ul>
<p>A conclusion is very important to a fully developed paper. Go beyond the ideas in your introduction. Have you proved your thesis?  All readers, including your professor, will ask the question: &quot;So what?&quot; The conclusion should make the relevance and importance of your research clear.</p>
                  <p>You are not required to use secondary sources (books, articles, internet) for this paper, but if you do, be sure to quote and document them properly and attach a &#147;Works Cited&#148; page. <strong>Plagiarism is a poor choice and will not be tolerated</strong>; consult the <a href="222CIsp13.html">Course Information</a> page about the NC State academic integrity policy; ask me if questions remain. For information on using research (if you do) and writing the documentation page, consult <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>, chapter 17.                </p>
                <p>Post due at midnight: original commentary on Kafka, response on Proust</p> 
<h2><span class="class">Class 39 (Eliot and the Surrealists)</span><span class="date"> due Wednesday, April 17</span></h2>
<p>Choose a poem from today's reading assignment to write about: &quot;The Hollow Men,&quot; &quot;Dadaist Disgust,&quot; &quot;Proclamation without Pretension,&quot; or &quot;Free Union.&quot; Answer Shannon's 4 questions. Note important images, poetic devices, and modernist elements. What does the poem defamiliarize or do that is unexpected? Write a sentence or two about what you think the poem means.</p>

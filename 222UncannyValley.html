<p class="style1">&quot;The Uncanny Valley is a concept developed by the Japanese robot scientist Masahiro Mori.[2] It concerns the design of humanoid robots. Mori&rsquo;s theory is relatively simple. We tend to reject robots that look too much like people. Slight discrepancies and incongruities between what we look like and what they look like disturb us. The closer a robot resembles a human, the more critical we become, the more sensitive to slight discrepancies, variations, imperfections. However, if we go far enough away from the humanoid, then we much more readily accept the robot as being like us. This accounts for the success of so many movie robots &mdash; from R2-D2 to WALL-E. They act like humans but they don&rsquo;t look like humans. There is a region of acceptability &mdash; the peaks around The Uncanny Valley, the zone of acceptability that includes completely human and sort of human but not too human. The existence of The Uncanny Valley also suggests that we are programmed by natural selection to scrutinize the behavior and appearance of others. Survival no doubt depends on such an innate ability.&quot; &mdash; E.M</p>

  In this course we will explore the Western literary tradition through reading, 
  discussing, and writing about some of the major works of European literature 
  from the eighteenth through twentieth centuries. We will also pay attention 
  to the political and cultural contexts of these works.<br>
  <br>
  <b>LEARNING GOALS</b><br>
  By the end of the course you should be able to: <br>
  &#149; explain the characteristics of the major literary periods of Western 
  Culture from the Enlightenment to Modernism <br>
  &#149; describe how a literary text reflects its historical context <br>
  &#149; identify the literary and rhetorical devices employed in a text, such 
  as genre, point of view, irony, etc., and relate them to the content of the 
  text <br>
  &#149; discuss, orally and in writing, selected literary texts of Western Culture 
  from the 18th century to the first half of the 20th century and their continuing 
  aesthetic validity or challenge <br>
  &#149; write a coherent essay on given topics about these texts and their contexts, 
  supporting arguments with evidence (quotes) from the literary texts.<br>
  <br>
  <b>GRADING<br>
  </b> Your grade in this course will be computed as follows: <br>
  <strong>Class Work</strong>: Attendance &amp; Participation (25%), Homework (65%), Poetry Presentation &amp; Quizzes (10%): 20%<br>
  <strong>Discussion Board </strong>or<strong> Reading Notebook</strong> 10%<br>
  <strong>Paper 1</strong>: 15%<br>
  <strong>Paper 2</strong>: 15%<br>
  <strong>Midterm</strong>: 15%<br>
  <strong>Final Exam</strong>: 25%<br>
  <br>
  There will be plus/minus grading in this class. The scale will be as follows:<br>
  A+ = 97.0-100, A = 93.0-96.9, A- = 90.0-92.9, <br>
  B+ = 87.0-89.9, B = 83.0-86.9, B- = 80.0-82.9, <br>
  C+ = 77.0-79.9, C = 73.0-76.9, C- = 70.0-72.9, <br>
  D+ = 67.0-69.9, D = 63.0-66.9, D- = 60.0-62.9, <br>
  F = 59.9 and below.<br>
  <br>
  <b>ATTENDANCE REGULATIONS</b>: Attendance is <b>required</b> and will be taken 
  daily. You are expected to arrive on time to class; repeated tardiness will 
  affect your grade. You are permitted three absences with no penalty. Each additional 
  absence will reduce your class participation grade by one grade (from A to A-, 
  from B+ to B, etc.). See me as soon as possible after an absence and provide 
  a written excuse to be accepted at my discretion (in case of illness, injury, 
  death or illness in the family, university duties, court attendance, or religious 
  observance). Save 
  your absences for emergencies. Excessive absences may lead to an F for the course. This 
  policy is based upon the University Attendance Policy at <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/academic_affairs/pols_regs/REG205.00.4.php">http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/academic_affairs/pols_regs/REG205.00.4.php</a><br>
  <br>
  If you need to miss a class, let me know 
  in person or by email before the class meeting, if possible. Upon your return 
  to class, you are responsible for all work missed and for any assignments announced during your absence. I suggest that you get the name, email/IM 
  or phone number of a classmate to contact in the event that you are unsure of 
  an assignment.<br>
  <br>
  <b> CLASS WORK: </b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>HOMEWORK<br>
</strong>There will be informal written assignments for nearly all class sessions. Assignments are  posted after each class on the <a href="222writingassignmentsfa06.htm">Daily Writing Assignment</a> page. They do not appear on the syllabus. </font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ATTENDANCE/ PARTICIPATION</font></strong><br>
  <font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The attendance/ particpation portion of the Class Work grade will be determined using the following criteria and attendance requirements above.<br>
  <br>
  A = you are well prepared and participate actively; you are attentive, respond 
when called upon and volunteer often with pertinent questions and comments. <br>
  B = you are usually prepared and always respond when called on; you volunteer 
  on occasion. <br>
  C= you show evidence of being unprepared; you have some trouble when called 
  on and do not volunteer often. <br>
  D = you are unprepared and/or inattentive; you never volunteer; you come to 
  class late and/or leave early. <br>
  F= you exhibit a lack of concern for the class; you sleep in class; your behavior 
may have a negative effect on the class</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">See below for discussion of the <a href="222poetrypresentation.html">Poetry Presentation</a> and quizzes.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>DISCUSSION BOARD</b>: 
  WebCT Discussions</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To enhance your 
  involvement with our texts, and extend class particpation outside of our limited 
  class time, you will be sharing observations and opinions on a class discussion 
  board. To access WebCT, go to <a href="http://vista.ncsu.edu">http://vista.nscu.edu</a> 
  and log in with your Unity ID and password. Once logged in, you will be brought 
  to your <b>my WebCT</b> page. Beneath the Courses header you will find links 
  to the home pages of classes in which you are enrolled that are using WebCT. Click on FL 222. This will take you to the FL 222 home page. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For your first visit to WebCT Vista, please click on the Student Orientation icon. Read <em>Getting Started with WebCT Vista</em>, Section 1, and T<em>he Discussions Tool</em>, Section 5. Follow the instructions to post a comment or response on a particular topic. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the home page, you will also find the Discussion Icon where the various discussion topics are listed. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For help with WebCT Vista, follow the Help links or call 515-HELP.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">In addition to 
  a first introductory post, you will be required to post at least 7 original 
  contributions (<b>oc </b>on the syllabus) on 7 different authors, each one at 
  least 7 lines long.  You should make at least one good point and provide evidence for your 
  statement, for example, explain your interpretation or support it with a quote 
  from the text.</font> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">You 
  can also make comparisons with other texts we have studied, make a comment on 
  a general theme (social rules and restrictions, utopia, boundaries), a specific 
  use of language, or invite discussion on a debatable point. In addition, you 
  are required to post 6 responses to contributions by others, again on 6 different 
  authors, each one must be at least 5 lines long.  Here, too, please support 
  your comment with evidence.  Before you post, please read what has already been written 
  to avoid duplication and a failing grade for that post. For the responses, please 
  comment directly on what has been written by at least one other student.</font> <font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is fine to post an original contribution and response on the same author.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Dates by which 
  your introduction, 7 original contributions and 6 responses should be posted are listed on 
  the <a href="222syfa06.html">Syllabus</a>. Since there are more than 17 authors 
  you have flexibility; however, late postings will <b>not </b>count towards your 
  grade. Cutoff is midnight when the date changes. You are responsible for a total of <strong>14 posts</strong>, including your self-introductory post to the class. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Discussion Board 
  postings will be graded pass/fail. If you pass, you'll get full credit: <strong>10% of your final grade</strong>. If your 
  first attempt at a contribution or response is a fail, we will discuss in the 
  office  and you'll have another chance for that first attempt. In order 
  not to get behind on your postings, I recommend that you make at least 3 original 
  contributions and 3 responses by Fall Break. You may post as often as you like 
  to contribute to the discussion, as long as you remain on topic.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>READING NOTEBOOK</b><br>
  As an alternative to the Discussion Board or for extra credit, you may choose 
  to keep a Reading Notebook which will be checked as indicated on the syllabus. 
  I recommend using a medium ring binder with tab dividers, but you can orgnize it your own way as long as you include the information listed below. You can also use a Wolfblog: <a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/instruction/blogs/createblog">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/instruction/blogs/createblog</a>.You will be graded on completeness, thoughtfulness, 
  and creativity: see <a href="222Gradingreadingnotebook.html">Notebook Grading 
  Rubric</a>.<br>
  <br>
  Section 1: <b>Just the facts</b>. One page for each work we study. Include title, 
  date, author, original language, main characters and setting, and a one paragraph 
  plot summary. These pages will be helpful when you study for exams.<br>
  <br>
  Section 2: <b>Vocabulary</b>. List of new or unfamiliar words you encounter 
  while reading or hear in class, including literary terms, along with their definitions. 
  (See also Shannon&#146;s Glossary of Literary Terms, pp. 202-208.) You should 
  have entries for each text.<br>
  <br>
  Section 3: <b>Lightning</b>: what struck you while you were reading. <br>
  For example: copy down memorable or provocative passages or images; include 
  your personal response to something you&#146;ve read--what it made you think 
  of in your own life. Shannon&#146;s 4 questions (p. 27) are helpful guides:<br>
  What is confusing?<br>
  What is repeated?<br>
  What is familiar?<br>
  What is strange?<br>
  <br>
  These notes will be helpful when you participate in class discussion and are 
  planning your papers. <br>
  <br>
  Section 4: Optional. Class reflections, notes, written work and tests returned, 
  etc.<br>
  <br>
</font><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EXAMS AND QUIZZES</b>: Students prepare assigned reading (see <a href="222syfa06.html">Syllabus</a>) 
  <b>before</b> coming to class. There may be  a pop-quiz during the semester. <br>
  <br>
  There will be a midterm and a final exam. Make-up for exams will be granted 
  only if you are excused <b>in advance</b> with proper documentation. <br>
  <br>
  Exams will consist of:<br>
  1) <strong>Identification</strong> of selected passages. Identify the <font color="#FF0000">author, work, approximate 
  date, and original language</font>. Briefly discuss the passage and 
    its relevance  to the work as a whole with attention to both form and content. <br>
  2) <strong>Short essay</strong> (200 words) on the <font color="#FF0000">literary movements</font> studied. You will be expected to define and illustrated the movement(s) by referring to authors, works, main ideas, relevant literary terms (satire, autobiography, absurd) and any appropriate social or historical events. <br>
  3) <strong>Long essay</strong> (300-400 words) on a given topic or theme and how it is treated in at least 
  two works we have studied. <br>
  <br>
  <b>PAPERS</b><br>
  In addition to the <a href="222writingassignmentsfa06.htm">informal writing assignments</a>, you will submit two papers in draft 
  and final form: the first should be 4-6 pages and the second 5-8 pages. Due 
  dates are listed on the <a href="222syfa06.html">Syllabus</a> and  assignment 
descriptions given in <a href="222Paper1-05.html">Paper 1</a> and</font> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="222Paper2-05.html">Paper 2</a>.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The honor pledge, &#147;I have neither given nor received unauthorized assistance 
    on this assignment&#148;  is included on the Self-evaluation and Reflective Statements which you will turn in with your final draft. You are responsible for printing and filling out the appropriate form for each paper: <a href="Selfevalref.html">Self-Evaluation and Reflective Statement for Paper 1</a> and <a href="Selfevalreffinal.html">Self-Evaluation and Reflective Statement for Paper 2</a>. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We will work with Edward A. Shannon&#146;s book to support your writing about 
      literature. You do not need to consult critical literature on the author or 
      the text, but should engage yourself closely with the text, or an aspect of 
      it, and formulate your thoughts about it in a organized way. I am most interested 
      in your own original ideas, not someone else&#146;s, nor in a paraphrase of 
      my comments from class, our class-discussions, or the readings themselves. <br>
  <br>
  Pay attention to good organization and logical transitions between paragraphs. 
Base your arguments on close readings. Give concrete examples (quotes) from 
the texts to support your arguments, but not to fill up space. Shannon has an excellent section on how to incorporate quotations into your paper: pages 151-163. I will be happy to work with you in the office on this skill. I have sample papers from previous classes that illustrate what I'm looking for in a good introduction or supporting quotations. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When referring 
    to the <em>Norton Anthology</em>, use the following simple format (Flaubert, <i>Madame 
      Bovary</i>, p. 928); for poems: (Blake, &#147;The Lamb,&#148; p. 543). The second and subsequent citations from the same work can be listed simply by page number.<br>
  <br>
  If you use ideas or quotes from critical literature (books, articles, internet, 
etc.), you need to document your sources and give proper credit to someone else&#146;s 
      ideas whether you quote directly or rephrase their ideas. Otherwise you 
      violate academic integrity and commit plagiarism (see below for policy). Do not 
      make someone else&#146;s ideas the major focus of your paper. For the format 
      of footnotes and bibliography, if you have them, refer to the MLA Style Manual 
      (available in bookstore or library) or Chapter 6 in Shannon. You can also use the NCSU Libraries' <a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/lobo2/citationbuilder/citationbuilder.php">Citation Builder</a>. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The conclusion is also a very important part of your paper: read Shannon's section on &quot;Writing a Conclusion&quot; (pages 98-99) and be sure you can answer the question: &quot;So what?&quot; before you turn in your paper!<br>
  <br>
  Papers are due at the beginning of the class period. Email submissions and late 
submissions will only be accepted with my permission. <br>

  <br>
          <strong>Supporting documents</strong>: We will use a peer review process as well as instructor review to help you improve 
    your writing. See the <a href="PeerReviewFeedback.html">Peer Review Feedback</a> form. Print out and bring two copies of this form for your classmates to fill out for you. You will also fill out a Self-Evaluation form to include along with the Peer Review Feedback forms and first drafts when you turn in your final 
        draft. You will lose points on your paper if these documents are not included. See <a href="222scoringrubric.html">Scoring Rubric</a> for details.<br>

  The Foreign Language Department takes the University Policy on Academic Integrity 
  very seriously. An atmosphere of trust, honesty and respect for each other fosters 
  educational progress and success. Please do not give me any reason to be suspicious 
  of your honesty. You are to do your own work on all class assignments, papers, 
  and exams, unless it is a designated pair or group assignment. For papers that 
  also means not incorporating others&#146; ideas and presenting them as your 
  own&#151;this is called plagiarism. Whether you take ideas (verbatim or just 
  as an idea) from books, the internet, or other sources does not matter; you 
  need to acknowledge their source if they are not your own. <em>Let me warn you especially 
  about the temptations of the internet.</em> You will find more details in Shannon, 
  pp. 148-150. <br>

      to a pleasant and productive semester! Don't hesitate to ask me for help or 
      moral support in person or by <a href="mailto:dbeckma@social.chasss.ncsu.edu">email</a>. 
      My personal teaching philosophy is reflected in this quotation from educator 
Haim Ginnott (1922-1973):</font></p>
<p> <font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#147;It's my 
  personal approach that creates the climate. It's my daily mood that makes the 
  weather. As a teacher, I possess a tremendous power to make a student's life 
  miserable or joyous. I can be a tool of torture or an instrument of inspiration. 
  I can humiliate or humor, hurt, or heal. In all situations, it is my response 
  that decides whether a crisis will be escalated or deescalated and a student 
  humanized or dehumanized.&#148; </font><br>

  <span class="style4">Discuss the following question after you do the reading assignment (Chapters 14-22). Is Eldorado a genuine utopia or (in one critic's words) &quot;a colossal bore&hellip;satirized by Voltaire as foolish and futile&quot;? Which specific behaviors or institutions show us that Voltaire wants the reader to see Eldorado as utopic?  Does Voltaire have a philosophical lesson in mind or is it pure satire? Or both?</span></span> How does it correspond to your personal view of Utopia? <span class="style4">Quote from the text with examples to support your answers and include the page reference for each quotation.</span></p>
<p class="style14">See Lecture Notes on <a href="222dulce.html">Dulce et utile</a>.</p>
<p class="style14">The first original contribution post&mdash;on Pope&mdash;is due Friday at midnight. You will have many authors to choose from to do your required 13 posts (7 original contributions and 6 responses), but I encourage you to get in the habit of posting by starting with Pope or Voltaire. For an original contribution post, make a point or develop an argument of at least 7 lines based on something you read, learned or thought while reading <em>An Essay on Man</em>. It can be helpful to ask a question or make a provocative statement for your classmates to respond to. Did something in your homework get praise or a lot of comment from me? If so, it might be the basis of a good post. <br />
    <br />
  Read Shannon, Chapter 2. </p>

  Read the page in Supplementary Materials, <a href="Candide%20quotes.html">Quotes from different critics about &quot;Il faut cultiver notre jardin.&quot; </a><br />
  Write a page answering the following questions: what are some  literal and figurative meanings of the word <em>garden</em>? How do they apply here? How do <strong>you</strong> interpret the final line of the story?What do I mean by <strong>literal</strong> and <strong>figurative</strong>? Here is an example I found online at <a href="http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm">http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm</a> : <br />
    <br />
  <strong>literal</strong> vs. <strong>figurative</strong> meaning - relates to the meanings of words and phrases or expressions. For example, &quot;She was all ears&quot; has a <strong>figurative</strong> meaning (She was listening intently) as well as a <strong>literal</strong> meaning (Her body was composed of ears or she had a huge set of ears).

    PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM<br />
&bull;
READER RESPONSE CRITICISM</span>Here are two additional sets of critical questions you may choose to address. They were written by a former student, Garry Pigg (Fall, 2005)</p>
<p class="style33">ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM </p>
<p class="style14">1. How do the environmental/ecological conditions within the setting of the work affect the language, mood, tone, and theme?<br />
  2. How does the use of the word &quot;nature&quot; in the work reflect the current scientific beliefs of the time and how does that affect the characters, plot, themes?<br />
  3. How does the relationship between man/woman and his/her environment--economically, agriculturally, botanically, socially--affect the characters, language, theme, plot, and tone? i.e. do the characters have to hunt and gather, farm, trade, live in city, country?<br />
  4. How do plants, animals, and their conditions in the environment affect the character's livelihood, the plot, the author's tone, the moods, the theme? i.e. the effects of individual species such as cows, camels, horses,goats, bananas, sugar, cotton, corn, potatoes, fungi, bacteria,<br />
  viruses; and ambient conditions such as drought, flooding, pollution, climate change, introduction of invasive species, and famine.</p>
<p class="style33">QUEER THEORY </p>
<p class="style14">1. How do the cultural feelings about sex affect the characters, plot, and themes?<br />
  2. How does sexual identity affect the characters? How do they deal with others and their own sexual deviance or breaking of social norms?<br />
  3. How does homosexuality or bisexuality play a role in the characters' lives, the tone, mood, theme, and plot of the work?<br />
  4. What role does sexuality play in the work?  How does it affect the use of language? Does it represent love and beauty or marriage and<br />
  reproduction?<br />
  5. How does religion affect the tendencies of the characters to express or not express themselves sexually?<br />
  6. How does the work represent sex and sexuality?  Does it use sexuality to define &quot;others&quot;? Does discussion of sex in the work hinder or help feminism?  Does it hurt or help racism, discrimination in general, and civil rights?  What is the connection between sexuality, race, gender, and social class in the work(s)?</p>

  -Emma is bound by her gender and subsequently the expected roles women are to uphold. Do you think her promiscuous behavoir and secret rendez-vous represent her deisre to live the life of a man and the freedoms of that gender? What other ways does Emma show her desire to be like a man? <br />
  - Throughout the story, all the men in Emma's life have the power to change her life. What specific incidents in the novel demonstrate the plight of women in her life?  How does Emma regain power? How does her attempt to gain power further illustrated her powelessness? <br />
  - Does Flaubert treat men and women differently?<br />
  - How are women's lives portrayed in <em>Madame Bovary</em>?<br />

  - Why doesn't the author portray Emma as a good wife?<br />
  - Why is Emma really into Rodolphe even though he shows her many times that he does not care?<br />

      -
      How does the character's work affect his/her behavior or thought process? What does it reveal about their mood? Do you think the character's work/duty has an impact on how they present themselves in society and how they view themselves in the world?<br />
- Do you think a character's emotions and behavior define who they are? Are they expressed internaly or extermally and are the characters able to keep them under control or do they let their emotions consume them?<br />
- What does it say about a character's psychological state when the author switches to their inner thoughts (free indirect discourse) without warning the reader? What does it say about a character's desires, dreams or fantasies?<br />
- Do you think that Monsieur Homais really thinks he is a medical expert? Sometimes people get so caught up in lies they believe it is the truth.

Pirandello is defamiliarizing (a term you'll hear a lot for the rest of the semester) reality and the theatrical illusion.

  </font>Father, an intellectual, marries a lower class woman; they have a son, but the Father becomes bored with his wife and sends her off to live with his male secretary. Father keeps custody of the Son, who is raised by a wet nurse and grows up to be very resentful. The wife obediently leaves the family home and she and the former secretary have 3 more children. The Father watches over them, but eventually they move away; the stepfather dies, and the wife and three children move back to the original town without telling the Father. Mother and Stepdaughter take jobs with a dressmaker, Madame Pace, who runs a call-girl service: Mother as a seamstress, Stepdaughter as a prostitute, who is ultimately hired by the Father. Family is reunited: explosive conflict.There is no daily writing assignment due on Friday or next Wednesday, since you have Paper 1 due next Monday and the third part of the midterm due next Wednesday.

  2) Also: </span><span class="style14">&quot;The Oedipus complex in Freudian psychoanalysis refers to stage of psychosexual development in childhood where children of both sexes regard their father as an adversary and competitor for the exclusive love of their mother. The name of the complex derives from the Greek myth of Oedipus, who unwittingly kills his father Laius and marries his mother Jocasta.<br />
  <br />
  Freud considered the successful resolution of the Oedipus complex to be key to the development of gender roles and identity, with boys and girls resolving the conflicts differently as a result of castration anxiety and penis envy. Freud also held that the unsuccessful resolution of the Oedipus complex could result in neurosis and homosexuality.&hellip; Although common usage refers to 'suffering from an Oedipus complex', psychoanalysis does not consider the complex a pathology, but instead a perfectly normal stage that all children go through. Oedipal desires are thought to remain heavily repressed and unconsciously in the minds of all functioning adults.</span>&quot; <br />

</p>
<p class="style14"> <span class="style58">Cultural and Historical:</span><br />

    &bull; How do Kafka's themes of isolation and social stigma and shame reflect the climate of 1920s Europe?  
      <br />
  &bull; How is Gregory's tardiness and reaction it gets a reflection of the time? <br />
  <br />
  <span class="style78">Psychological:</span><br />
&bull; Do you think Gregor's emotions and behavior define who he is?<br />
&bull; How does <em>Metamorphosis</em> reflect Kafka's personal psychology?<br />

  &bull; How does the reader respond to the work?<br />
    &bull; How do the reactions of Gregory's family members affect the interpretation of the story?<br />
    &bull; Let's  
  say you could choose any animal in the world to morph into. What animal would you choose?<br />
  &bull; Is the family's reaction to Gregory's transformation what you would expect? How would you react if this happened to someone in your family?<br />
  &bull;  Have you ever felt like a bug, as in very different from anyone else?  
  <br />
  <br />

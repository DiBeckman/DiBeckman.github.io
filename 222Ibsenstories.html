<span class="teal"><strong>Hedda Gabler: What Should Have Happened</strong><br />
by Ashley Hinkleman </span>
<p align="left" class="style1"><br />
  She was trapped; unfortunately there was no mistaking that.&nbsp; Her husband&rsquo;s face was always smiling and jovial in public, but she saw him otherwise, saw the hold that he had on her, the fine gold leash around her neck.&nbsp; And only because he was her husband did he have that hold.&nbsp; She resented him for that, for that control he had over her because of a simple, but holding, bond.&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She was in his power.&nbsp; Totally subject to his demands &ndash; and his will.&nbsp; Not free. Not free at all</em>&nbsp; (1465).&nbsp; She was always afraid of what he would demand of her when he was near her; his actions were never the same twice.&nbsp; She could never guess; he was the one man that could best her in a battle of wits, and yet it always galled her when he did.&nbsp; She was not scared, oh no.&nbsp; But she did not like bring trapped.&nbsp; Her <em>human destiny</em> (1455) was in the hands of another.&nbsp; It made her feel small, helpless even.&nbsp; And Hedda Gabler did not like feeling helpless.&nbsp; It was not in her nature.<br />
  <br />
  But she knew she did not have to be like this for much longer.&nbsp; No, soon she would end this fa&ccedil;ade.&nbsp; The waiting was almost over, and when it happened&hellip; then she would have nothing to worry about.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  She had thought she might enjoy it, marrying Judge Brack.&nbsp; He had been a companion to her, someone that she had been able to talk with as he escorted her home after parties.&nbsp; Unfortunately his feelings for her did not go unvoiced, and one night he destroyed their comfortable friendship by proposing to her.&nbsp; She had been surprised, having never thought of Brack as the sort of man to marry.&nbsp; Later, his intentions had become clear when she discovered that he was planning to go into politics, and certain social necessities were required before he could apply for the appointment&hellip; But she had not known this.&nbsp; At the time, she had only realized that <em>she&rsquo;d danced herself out.&nbsp; Her time was up</em>, and she needed a partner (1431).&nbsp; And why not Judge Brack?&nbsp; He had made himself to be a charming man, though shamefully forward in his approach at times.&nbsp; He was not dull witted, and his prospects were good.&nbsp; Most importantly, he was upper class, and well known in her circle. <br />
  <br />
  Not like that George Tesman, who had spent money based on his prospects and was now deeply in debt, especially after his appointment had not come through.&nbsp; To think, it had gone to Eilert L&oslash;vborg!&nbsp; All because of that book of his.&nbsp; How surprised she had been when she heard that he was back in town, proclaiming to be a remade man.&nbsp; She had never had high hopes for him and his career after he had ruined his reputation with drink, and then he came walking back in to take that fool&rsquo;s place at the local college.&nbsp; Well, now he could serve a purpose to her.<br />
  <br />
  It would all be so simple. &nbsp;She would rise to greet L&oslash;vborg when he arrived, as a special friend.&nbsp; Oh, there would be other guests, Tesman, his Aunt, even that Thea Elvstead had been invited for dinner.&nbsp; She had heard about a certain relationship between Mr. L&oslash;vborg and Mrs. Elvstead, a relationship that seemed to be the cause of L&oslash;vborg&rsquo;s newfound abstinence&hellip; No matter.&nbsp; Mrs. Elvstead would be a witness to the events of tonight, a witness to prove her guiltless in everything that happened.<br />
  <br />
  She would take his hand, yes, and speak to him for a few moments, just the way they used to.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps she would show him to the other guests, let him talk with them for a moment, but nothing to distract his attention from her.&nbsp; She must make sure he tried the punch, and had something to drink.&nbsp; Dear Brack would help with that, no doubt.&nbsp; In his eyes, any man who refused a drink did not, indeed, <em>feel really bold, really sure of himself </em>(1442).&nbsp; Brack might even say so to L&oslash;vborg &ndash; yes, that would work.&nbsp; But perhaps that might not do, might not be enough; she would have to voice these opinions herself, to test her power over him, to make absolutely sure that everything would go as she had planned it&hellip;but it would.&nbsp; There was no reason why it would not, not after what she would do then.<br />
  After L&oslash;vborg had had something to drink, she would draw him aside, away from the other guests.&nbsp; The pistol case must be on top of the writing desk, of course, out where he would see it.&nbsp; He would know the case, know it very well; after all, he had spent many days in her father&rsquo;s house, had known very well the case of the pistol she had almost shot him with&hellip; When they were standing near the desk, in the middle of speaking together, then she would mention, ever so subtly, that perhaps there might have been something between them then; something might still exist between them even now.&nbsp; If only, if only, she had known he would be coming back, then she would not have married Brack, might have, instead&hellip; Ah, but it was useless now, she was wed to Brack, and while he lived there could be nothing between them, for as long as she was married.&nbsp; And how horrible it was!&nbsp; Brack&rsquo;s cruelty to her was almost unbearable.&nbsp; Why, just last week&hellip;but no, they mustn&rsquo;t talk about that here, not while Brack was so near.&nbsp; Oh, if only he could do something to help her!<br />
  <br />
  And then she would watch the outrage and recognition rise behind his eyes, clouded with the effects of alcohol, and she would have to hide it, hide her excitement as the plan unfolded.&nbsp; She knew L&oslash;vborg, knew him well enough from his confessions of drunken frenzy to know what he would do then, with the pistol and Brack both so close.&nbsp; No one would blame her, the innocent bystander at the scene, helplessly watching the events before her.&nbsp; There would be no scandal on her name.&nbsp; Poor L&oslash;vborg, the dear, would face charges, but what did that matter to her, after he had ruined their camaraderie?<br />
  <br />
  And Brack was a wealthy man.&nbsp; When he was gone, who would there be to inherit his wealth, his possessions?&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  Who, indeed, but his poor widow?<br />
  <br />
  She had waited so long.&nbsp; All her wishes, all her longings, would be fulfilled after this night.&nbsp; Her father&rsquo;s pistols, lovingly and meticulously shined and polished, awaited their duty in their case made of dark mahogany wood.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  Her thoughts were interrupted as the maid stepped into the room.<br />
  <br />
  &ldquo;Madam, Mr. L&oslash;vborg has arrived.&rdquo;<br />
  <br />
  Hedda smiled.&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;Yes, please, show him in&rdquo; </em>(1435).<br />
  <br />
  She would be free.&nbsp; </p>

  by Candace Perry</span><br />
  SCENE I<br />
  L&Oslash;VBORG exits the TESMANS' house from the hallway door and emerges onto the street outside the house.  There are autumn leaves scattered on the ground. L&Oslash;VBORG moves his hat about in a circular motion in his hands, not sure what to do next.  BRACK is coming up the street towards L&Oslash;VBORG.  L&Oslash;VBORG spots BRACK and begins to walk in the opposite direction to avoid BRACK, as if he does not want to relive his humiliation from last night.  However, BRACK sees him and quickens his pace to catch up to him.<br />
  BRACK     Mr. L&oslash;vborg!<br />
  L&Oslash;VBORG     [Keeps walking as though he has not heard BRACK.]<br />
  BRACK     [Quickens his pace and catches up to L&Oslash;VBORG.] Mr. L&oslash;vborg!  Will you please talk for a moment?  I want to be certain that you are all right, especially after last night's festivities.<br />
  L&Oslash;VBORG     [A bit distracted.] I am fine, thank you. <br />
  BRACK     Are you sure, Mr. L&oslash;vborg?  You seem a bit upset?<br />
  L&Oslash;VBORG     Upset?  No, no, not at all.  However, I am afraid I cannot talk now.  There is somewhere I must go.<br />
  BRACK     [Smiling, but not pleasantly.] Yes, yes, of course.  Well, have a pleasant afternoon, Mr. L&oslash;vborg.  [Takes a few steps away from L&Oslash;VBORG, turns.]  Oh!  Mr. L&oslash;vborg!  Did you ever find what you lost last night?<br />
  L&Oslash;VBORG	[Startled.] What?  Oh, yes, I did.  [Looks at BRACK, who is smiling. Drops his hat and places his hands over his face.]  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  What have I done?<br />
  BRACK     Mr. L&oslash;vborg!  What is the matter?  Is this about what you lost?<br />
  L&Oslash;VBORG     [Realizing the mistake of his outburst.]  No, no.  It's about my manuscript.  I've torn it to pieces.  My life, my work.  It is all torn to pieces!<br />
  BRACK     [Picks up L&Oslash;VBORG'S hat and hands it to him.] I am sorry to hear this, Mr. L&oslash;vborg, but I am sure it's for the best.  Now, perhaps you should go somewhere different, start something new.<br />
  L&Oslash;VBORG     [Suddenly excited.] It was my life.  It was my soul.  I must get it back!  I must!  [Hurriedly runs off the stage, away from BRACK.]<br />
  BRACK     [Smiling cheerfully.] Good day, Mr. L&oslash;vborg!  Good day!  [Turns on his heel and walks back the way he came, whistling &quot;In the Hall of the Mountain King&quot; from Grieg's Peer Gynt.] <br />
  SCENE II<br />
  L&Oslash;VBORG frantically runs into DIANA'S boudoir.  The room is decorated in bright tones of red, orange, and yellow.  In the right wall is a window with the curtains drawn.  A long couch covers the opposing wall and two corner-sofas are in the right and left-hand upper corners.  Below the window there is a writing desk with a vase of brightly colored flowers on top.  DIANA, wearing a green, tightly fitted dress with her red hair curled and placed elegantly on top of her head, is seated in a well-cushioned, high back chair at the desk as L&Oslash;VBORG enters. <br />
  L&Oslash;VBORG     [Yelling in a dazed voice.] I want it back! It's mine! Give it back!<br />
  DIANA     [Turning from her desk and rising quickly.] Eilert! What are you doing here? I thought we settled this last night!<br />
  L&Oslash;VBORG     I want it back! I want my child! <br />
  DIANA     Child? Eliert, what are you talking about? You don't have a child! <br />
  L&Oslash;VBORG     Yes, I do! [Pointing at DIANA.] And you stole her from me! <br />
  DIANA     This is ridiculous. Eilert, you need to go. Otherwise I'll have no choice, but to call the police.<br />
  L&Oslash;VBORG     [Pulls gun from coat pocket and points it at DIANA.] I'm not leaving without my child! [Speaking softly.] I can't leave without her. <br />
  DIANA     [Backing away from L&Oslash;VBORG.] Eilert, please, I don't have your child. I don't know where she is, but I didn't take her. [Stops backing away and looks into L&Oslash;VBORG'S face.] Eilert, look at me. See I'm telling the truth.<br />
  L&Oslash;VBORG     [Still pointing the gun at DIANA, lifts his eyes to meet hers. A moment passes before he speaks.] Oh God, Diana, Diana, I am so sorry. Look at me; I really have torn my life to pieces. I must put an end to it all. [Turns the gun on himself, pointing it at his head.]<br />
  DIANA     [Rushing towards Eilert.] Eilert, no! You have so much to live for. Think of your work! <br />
  L&Oslash;VBORG     My work is lost! My life is lost! Good-bye, Diana! [Cocks the pistol.]<br />
  DIANA     No! [Reaches for the gun and gets a hand on it. L&Oslash;VBORG'S hand is forced down, so the gun is now pointing at his stomach. It goes off with a bang. The pistol falls from their hands and L&Oslash;VBORG places his own hands on his wound. Blood is staining the front of his coat as he falls to the ground. DIANA falls to her knees beside him and cradles his head in her hands.] Eilert, I'm so sorry. Eilert.<br />
  L&Oslash;VBORG     [Speaking softly.] Are there vine leaves in my hair? [Closes his eyes and dies.]<br />
DIANA     [Places his head on the ground.] Good-bye, Eilert. [Kisses him on the lips and lingers over his face for a moment. Looks at the gun on the ground.] What am I going to do? I can't risk going to jail. [Picks up the gun and places it back in his coat pocket.] There, now the authorities will never know what really happened. Good-bye, Eilert. [Gets up from the floor and runs off stage yelling for help.]</p>

  College is for learning-but not everyone's learning style is the same. According to type theory; each of the sixteen types has a different style that works best for them. If you are having difficulty learning new material it may be because you are trying to learn in a way that is not consistent with your natural style. Or you may be using your preferred style so exclusively that you miss the chance to use other strategies when they may be more <br /> 
  appropriate.</p>

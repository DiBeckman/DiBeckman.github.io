<h1>Baroque Music</h1>
<p>Liner notes from the CDs <em>A Baroque Festival</em> (1600-1750) by Rob Enslin © MCMXCII Intersound Inc.</p>
<p>One of the most revolutionary periods in Western music was the Baroque. Roughly spanning from 1600 to 1750, the Baroque Era witnessed a new musical language that supported harmonic complexity and thematic contrast. The leading Baroque composers were Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750), George Frideric Handel (1685-1759), Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741) and Arcangelo Corelli (1653-17130.</p>
<p>The word <em>baroque</em> is French and means <em>bizarre</em>. The term was first used to describe the ornate architecture of 17th and 18th century Germany and Austria. By the mid-1700s, it also expressed comparable developments in painting and music. Not until the 1940s did the word become a label for 17th and 18th century music.</p>
<p>While the Baroque remains an artistically nebulous era, it was united by a common goal: expression. During the Renaissance (1400-1600), music was predominantly linear and monophonic (i.e., having a single melody without harmonies and counter-melodies). The Baroque sought to expand the palette by introducing ornamentation, tonality, dynamics and polyphony (i.e., having two or more melodies played at once). The results <em>were</em> bizarre but, nonetheless, individualistic.</p>
<p>As the vocabulary increased, so did form and instrumentation. One of the greatest creations was Italian opera. In the 1570s, Florentine poets and musicians began reviving ancient Greek theater. Unlike that of the Renaissance, Baroque theater made music an integral part of the drama. Two developments were the recitative and aria. The former is a narrative type of singing that is melodic and free in rhythm. The latter, which stems form the recitative, is a self-contained vocal piece that is highly expressive and structured. The best known Baroque opera was <span class="text">Orpheus and Eurydice</span> by Christoph Willibald von Gluck (1714-1787).</p>
<p>In the Church, the quest for expression was equally strong. A major development was the cantata, which is a musical form for voices and instruments. Cantatas are secular or religious and derive from the Italian recitative. Two leading proponents of the cantata were Alessandro Scarlatti (1660-1725), who composed over 600 of them and Bach, who perfected the sacred cantata. </p>
<p>Another invention was the oratorio. Designed primarily for the secular stage, an oratorio is a dramatic musical setting performed without scenery or costumes. Most Baroque oratorios were religious, the greatest being Handel's <span class="text">Messiah</span>. Scarlatti and Heinrich Schütz (1585-1672) also composed numerous oratorios. </p>
<p>Like its vocal counterpart, instrumental music saw many developments during the Baroque. The most profound was the <em>concerto grosso</em> (<em>great concerto</em>), which was created at the end of the 1600s by Giuseppe Torelli (1658-1709) and Corelli. This type of concerto was in three or four movements and pitted a small group of soloists against a full orchestra. The most popular <em>concerti grossi </em>are Bach's <em>Brandenburg Concertos</em> and those by Handel and Vivaldi. During the mid-1700s, the <em>concerto grosso</em> yielded the three-movement solo concerto, where one instrument competes against a full orchestra.</p>
<p>The modern-day symphony is also rooted in the Baroque. Like an overture, the Baroque <em>sinfonia</em> was a slow, one-movement piece that preceded scenes of an opera. Scarlatti flanked the slow passage with two faster ones, creating a standardized, three-movement <em>sinfonie</em>. With the introduction of the third-movement minuet in the last 1700s, the classic, four-movement symphony (and later the string quartet) was born.</p>
<p>Common to both the concerto and symphony is what is known as first-movement sonata form. Evolving during the first half of the 1700s, this structure contains three sections: the exposition, which announces the main melody; the development, which expands upon it; and the recapitulation, which repeats the melody in modified form. This simple form was not only highly fertile, but also very prevalent in the ensuing Classical period.</p>
<p>Instruments popular during the Baroque period were the violin, lute, trumpet, organ, bagpipe and drum. Also common were ancestors of the oboe, bassoon and trombone. In the Church, many instruments were separated into choirs, creating astounding stereophonic effects. As Baroque music grew more sophisticated, so did the fabrication and orchestration of these instruments.</p>
<h1>Romantic Music</h1>
<p>(from <span class="text">Romantic Music for Dummies</span> ©1997 IDG Books Worldwide, Inc.)</p>
<p>Romantic music can be summed up as emotional music, subjective and free. It's passionate music, exotic music, and oftentimes rage music, and evolved from the classical period, which occurred from the mid-1700s to about 1820.</p>
<p>During the classical period, people restrained themselves and their music from all the fun stuff—things of a passionate, emotional, or exotic nature. They all had rules and regulations for everything so that people could behave properly at all times. And because music always reflects its time in history, classical music was born. <em>Classical music</em> was intellectual music—formal and traditional music—characterized by grace, restraint, and elegance…And to keep in tune with all the rules and regulations of the day, classical music also had a formulaic and repetitious style. Abandoning all the rules and letting out savage rage and passion weren't trendy—at least not until about 1820. That's when all emotions were unleashed, and romantic music was born.</p>
<p>So who were the great romantic composers? …two of the best early romantics were Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) and Franz Shubert (1797-1828). Some of the best full-swing romantics were Gioacchino Rossini (1792-1868), Hector Berlioz (1803-1869), Frédéric Chopin (1810-1849), Richard Wagner (1813-1883), César Frank (1822-1890), Johannes Brahms (1833-1897) and Piotr Ilych Tchaikovsky (1840-1893).</p>

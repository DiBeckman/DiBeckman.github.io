<p class="style1"><strong>&Agrave; bout de souffle (Breathless)</strong>: written by Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut and directed by Jean-Luc Godard. Originally released as a motion picture in 1960. There was before <em>Breathless</em>, and there was after <em>Breathless</em>. With its lack of polish, surplus of attitude, crackling personalities of rising stars Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg, and anything-goes crime narrative, Jean-Luc Godard's debut fashioned a simultaneous homage to and critique of the American film genres that influenced and rocked him as a film writer for Cahiers du cinema. Jazzy, free-form, and sexy, <em>Breathless</em> (<em>À bout de souffle</em>) helped launch the French New Wave and ensured cinema would never be the same.</p>
<p class="style1">Breathless (French: &Agrave; bout de souffle; &quot;out of breath&quot;) is a 1960 French film directed by Jean-Luc Godard. It was his first feature-length work, and one of the earliest, most influential of the French New Wave. At the time, the film attracted much attention for its bold visual style and the innovative use of jump cuts. Breathless, together with Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut's The 400 Blows and Alain Resnais's Hiroshima, Mon Amour, both released a year earlier, brought international acclaim to the French Nouvelle Vague.<br />
A fully restored version of the film was released in the U.S. for the 50th anniversary of the film in May 2010. When originally released in France, the film had 2,082,760 cinema goers. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bout_de_Souffle">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bout_de_Souffle</a></p>

<p class="style3">IMDB Summary: Teacher Fran&ccedil;ois Marin and his colleagues are preparing for another school year teaching at a racially mixed inner city high school in Paris. The teachers talk to each other about their prospective students, both the good and the bad. The teachers collectively want to inspire their students, but each teacher is an individual who will do things in his or her own way to achieve the results they desire. They also have differing viewpoints on the students themselves, and how best to praise and discipline them. The administration of the school tries to be as fair as possible, which includes having student representatives sit on the student evaluation committee. Marin's class this year of fourteen and fifteen year olds is no different than previous years, although the names and faces have changed. Marin tries to get through to his students, sometimes with success and sometimes resulting in utter failure. Even Marin has his breaking point, which may result in him doing things he would probably admit to himself are wrong. But after all is said and done, there is next year and another group of students. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068646/plotsummary">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068646/plotsummary<br />

<p class="style3">IMDB plot summary:<em> Le Fabuleux Destin d'Am&eacute;lie Poulain</em> is a film about an extremely imaginative young girl, Amelie (Audrey Tautou), who had a very isolated upbringing. The film begins by explaining what happened to her as a child and then moves on to see her moving into her own flat and with her first job as a waitress. The story line is fairly mundane but is jazzed up by Amelie's ways of dealing with things, she meets a man, Nino Quincampoix (Mathieu Kassovitz), and basically plays a game with him. He lost one of his photo albums which she later finds. Instead of simply returning the photo album she does it in a truely unique and exciting manner. The film is presented in a magical way where the viewer is bombarded with trivial yet sweet information on the arrival of any new character, the interesting subplots throughout the film and the strange thoughts and crazy antics of Amelie herself. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0211915/synopsis">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0211915/synopsis</a></p>

<p><strong>Grande Illusion (La grande illusion)</strong>: written by Charles Spaak &amp; Jean Renoir and directed by Jean Renoir. Originally released as a motion picture in 1937. Frequently cited as both one of the greatest films about war and one of the greatest films ever made, Jean Renoir's <span class="text">La Grande Illusion</span> is an often witty, sometimes poignant, frequently moving examination of the futility of war. During World War I, two French airmen are shot down while taking surveillance photographs in German territory: Capt. de Boeldieu (Pierre Fresnay), a wealthy and aristocratic officer; Lt. Mar&eacute;chal (Jean Gabin), a burly but intelligent working-class mechanic. The three are brought to a P.O.W. camp, where they encounter and befriend Rosenthal (Marcel Dalio), a prosperous Jewish banker, and the commander, Von Rauffenstein (Erich von Stroheim), takes an immediate liking to de Boeldieu. They are members of the same social class and believe that the political and intellectual ideals of the Europe they once knew will soon be a thing of the past with the rise to power of the proletariat. The three Frenchmen discover that their fellow prisoners have been digging an escape tunnel, and all of them agree to help -- Mar&eacute;chal and Rosenthal with enthusiasm, de Boeldieu out of a sense of duty. As he puts it, when on a golf course, one plays golf, and while in a prison camp, one tries to escape -- it's the accepted thing to do. As Von Rauffenstein and de Boeldieu become friends, and the rank-and-file soldiers banter as much with the German guards as with each other, the characters seem involved less in a war than in some vast, petty game, albeit one with deadly consequences; they often talk about women and food, while never mentioning political ideology.</p>
<p><span class="text">La Grande Illusion</span> (also known as <em>Grand Illusion</em>) is a 1937 French war film directed by Jean Renoir, who co-wrote the screenplay with Charles Spaak. The story concerns class relationships among a small group of French officers who are prisoners of war during World War I and are plotting an escape. The title of the film comes from the book <span class="text">The Great Illusion</span> by British economist Norman Angell, which argued that war is futile because of the common economic interests of all European nations. The perspective of the film is generously humanistic to its characters of various nationalities. It is regarded by critics and film historians as one of the masterpieces of French cinema and among the greatest films ever made. Orson Welles named <em>La Grande Illusion</em> as one of the movies he would take with him &quot;on the ark.&quot; Empire magazine ranked it #35 in &quot;The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema&quot; in 2010. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Grande_Illusion">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Grande_Illusion</a></p>

<p><strong>La haine (La Haine)</strong>: written and directed by Mathieu Kassovitz. Originally released as a motion picture in 1995. While to most outsiders Paris seems the very picture of beauty and civility, France has had a long and unfortunate history of intolerance toward outsiders, and this powerful drama from filmmaker Mathieu Kassovitz takes an unblinking look at a racially diverse group of young people trapped in the Parisian economic and social underclass. Vinz (Vincent Cassel), who is Jewish, Hubert (Hubert Kounde), who is Black, and Said (Said Taghmaoui), who is Arabic, are young men from the lower rungs of the French economic ladder; they have no jobs, few prospects, and no productive way to spend their time. They hang out and wander the streets as a way of filling their days and are sometimes caught up in frequent skirmishes between the police and other disaffected youth. One day, a street riot breaks out after police seriously injure an Arab student; the three friends are arrested and questioned, and it is learned that a policeman lost a gun in the chaos. However, what they don't know is that Vinz picked it up and has it in his possession, and when Vinz, Hubert, and Said get into a scuffle with a group of racist skinheads, the circumstances seem poised for tragedy. Actress Jodie Foster was so impressed with<span class="text"> La Haine</span> when she saw it at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival that she helped to arrange American distribution for the film through her production company, Egg Pictures.</p>

<p><strong>Joyeux Noël (Joyeux Noel)</strong>: written and directed by Christian Carion. Originally released as motion picture in 2005. The year is 1914, and as World War I continues to rage across the European countryside, four individuals stuck on the front lines find themselves faced with the unthinkable in director Christian Carion's Academy Award-nominated account of the true-life wartime event that would offer hope for peace in mankind's darkest hour. When the war machines began rolling in the summer of 1914, the devastation that it waged upon German, British, and French troops was palpable. As the winter winds began to blow and the soldiers sat huddled in their trenches awaiting the generous Christmas care packages sent by the families, the sounds of warfare took a momentary backseat to the yearning for brotherhood among all of mankind. It is here that the fate of a French lieutenant, a Scottish priest, a German tenor, and a Danish soprano's lives were about to be changed forever. On Christmas Eve of that year, the lonely souls of the front lines abandoned their arms to reach out to their enemies on the battlefield and greet them with not anger or hostility, but with the simple, kindly gesture of a much needed cigarette or a treasured piece of chocolate, and to put their differences aside long enough to wish their brothers a sincere &quot;Merry Christmas!&quot;</p>
<p><em>Joyeux Noël</em> (English: <em>Merry Christmas</em>) is a 2005 French film about the World War I Christmas truce of December 1914, depicted through the eyes of French, Scottish and German soldiers. It was written and directed by Christian Carion. It was screened out of competition at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. The film was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 78th Academy Awards. The film was one of Ian Richardson's last appearances before his death on 9 February 2007. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyeux_No%C3%ABl">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyeux_No%C3%ABl</a></p>

<p><strong>Jules et Jim (Jules and Jim)</strong>: written by Henri-Pierre Roché and directed by François Truffaut. Originally released as a motion picture in 1962. Acclaimed French director François Truffaut's third and, for many viewers, best film is an adaptation of a semi-autobiographical novel by Henri-Pierre Roché. Set between 1912 and 1933, it stars Oskar Werner as the German Jules and Henri Serre as the Frenchman Jim, kindred spirits who, while on holiday in Greece, fall in love with the smile on the face of a sculpture. Back in Paris, the smile comes to life in the person of Catherine (Jeanne Moreau); the three individuals become constant companions, determined to live their lives to the fullest despite the World War around them. When Jules declares his love for Catherine, Jim agrees to let Jules pursue her, despite his own similar feelings; Jules and Catherine marry and have a child (Sabine Haudepin), but Catherine still loves Jim as well. An influential film that has grown in stature over the decades,<em> Jules et Jim</em> was often viewed by the counterculture of the 1960s as a cinematic proponent of the free-love movement, but in actuality the picture is a statement against such a way of life. Despite the bond shared by Jules, Jim, and Catherine, their <em>ménage à trois</em> is doomed to fail; and Catherine's inability to choose between the two men leads to tragic consequences for all three.</p>
<p><em>Jules and Jim</em> (French: <em>Jules et Jim</em>, IPA: [ʒyl e dʒim]) is a 1962 French film directed by François Truffaut based on Henri-Pierre Roché's 1953 semi-autobiographical novel about his relationship with young writer Franz Hessel and Helen Grund, whom Hessel married. </p>
<p>Truffaut came across the book in the mid-1950s whilst browsing through some secondhand books at a bookseller along the Seine in Paris. Later he befriended the elderly Roché, who published his first novel at the age of 74. The author approved of the young director's interest to adapt his work to another medium. The soundtrack by Georges Delerue was named as one of the &quot;10 best soundtracks&quot; by Time magazine in its &quot;All Time 100 Movies&quot; list. The film ranked 46 in Empire magazine's &quot;The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema&quot; in 2010. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_et_jim">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_et_jim </a></p>

<p class="style3">IMDB Summary: Fran&ccedil;ois is a middle-aged antique dealer. He has a stylish apartment and a fabulous life, but at a dinner with a group he considers his dearest acquaintances, he is blindsided by the revelation that none of them actually likes him. He's arrogant, self-centered and harsh, and they don't believe he knows the meaning of friendship. His business partner Catherine makes him a bet: if he can produce his best friend, she will let him keep the massive Greek vase he acquired that afternoon on the company tab. If not, it's hers. Having accepted the wager, Fran&ccedil;ois naively tears through his address book, trying to shoehorn an increasingly unlikely series of contacts into the all-important role. Moving through Paris, he keeps encountering a trivia-spouting, big-hearted cabbie named Bruno. Bruno's chatty, lowbrow ways grate against Fran&ccedil;ois's designer temperament, but he covets the other man's easy way with people. He convinces Bruno to teach him how to make friends and sets about learning the &quot;three S's&quot; - being sociable, smiling and sincere - though they don't come easy. Ultimately, Fran&ccedil;ois' victory will depend on Bruno's naivet&eacute; in playing along, but what's the cost of cheating at friendship? <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0778784/plotsummary">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0778784/plotsummary</a></p>

<p class="style3"><strong>Le Placard (The Closet)</strong>: written and directed by Francis Veber. Originally released as a motion picture in 2001. Fran&ccedil;ois Pignon, a very bland sort of man who works as an accountant in a condom factory, is about to be fired. His new neighbour comes up with an idea to prevent such a thing from happening: he creates photos and then spreads the rumor that Fran&ccedil;ois is gay so that the factory management might be afraid they'll be sued for sexual discrimination. Of course, nothing happens as it should, but the changes in Fran&ccedil;ois Pignon's life-- and other people's too - are drastic!</p>
<p class="style3">IMDB plot summary: Fran&ccedil;ois Pignon (Daniel Auteuil) is a non-entity accountant, divorced two years but still in love with his wife and wanting a better relationship with their 17 year old son. Then, he is the last in his company to hear that he is to be fired. A neighbour suggests that Pignon creates the impression that he is gay, so that the company executives will find it difficult to fire him or else be thought homophobic. The plan works. Meanwhile, F&eacute;lix Santini (G&eacute;rard Depardieu) is convinced, by joking fellow-executives, that Santini must treat Pignon particularly well or run the risk of charges of homophobia. Santini's bumbling attempts at positive contact with Pignon make the middle of the movie somewhat silly, but Depardieu's straight-faced believability saves this part of the movie.<br />

<strong>Les poupées russes (Russian Dolls)</strong>: written and directed by Cédric Klapisch. Originally released as a motion picture in 2005. A French writer finds his life is once again being turned sideways by his footloose European friends in this sequel to the international hit <em>L'Auberge Espagnole</em>. Five years after we last saw him, Xavier (Romain Duris) has given up his aspirations of a career in international finance, but his new path as a writer isn't going as well as he hoped; his novel about his experiences in Spain has yet to be published, and lately he's been writing scripts for a French soap opera. When his French producers enter into a co-production agreement with a British network and Xavier lands an assignment ghost-writing a tell-all autobiography for famous fashion model Celia Shelburn (Lucy Gordon), he finds himself spending plenty of time traveling between Paris and London. In London, Xavier becomes reacquainted with Wendy (Kelly Reilly), whom he met during his time in Spain, and he wonders if he should take another stab at a relationship with her; Wendy is currently involved, but is increasingly frustrated with her boyfriend's drug problems and mood swings. Xavier is also infatuated with Celia, and wonders if a dalliance with the glamorous model might be possible. Needing romantic advice, Xavier turns to another old friend, Isabelle (Cécile De France), a lesbian who offers her understanding of women as well as a spare bedroom in her flat. Xavier also gets pointers from his ex-girlfriend Martine (Audrey Tautou), who has a child from a former beau and is trying to sort out her own romantic troubles. <em>Russian Dolls</em> (aka <em>Les Poupées russes</em>) also features Kevin Bishop, reprising his role as William from the first film.</p>

<p class="style3">IMDB Summary: Luis Costa (Alain Chabat) is living a charmed life: he is a successful perfume designer, known around the office as &quot;Le Nez&quot; (the nose), he is a handsome forty-something, and above all, he's carefree and single. He dates whomever he pleases and happily lives alone.  Luis' happy existence is threatened when his strongwilled mother and five equally overbearing sisters decide it's time for him to marry. They are sick of doing his laundry, cooking his meals and waiting on him hand and foot, so they set him up on a seemingly neverending series of blind dates with all of the single women they know (and even some that they don't -- found via the internet).  After a month of exhausting bad dates, and too afraid to take on his family, Luis hatches a hare-brained scheme: he will find the &quot;perfect woman,&quot; pay her to pose as his fiancee and charm his family, but then jilt him at the altar on their wedding day. That way, his family will feel sorry for him and never mention marriage to him ever again. Emmanuelle (Charlotte Gainsbourg), his best friend's sister, has just moved to Paris and is looking for a quick way to earn some cash. It seems like a win-win situation, but the best-laid plans of single men can go horribly and hilariously wrong. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478724/synopsis">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478724/synopsis</a></p>

The teenage life and adventures of young José who lives in a shanty-town on Martinique in the mid-'30s comprises the body of this well-wrought film on how to enjoy what you have. José lives with his grandmother and is well aware of the French colonial presence but they are far away from his world. He gets into mischief, learns valuable lessons on living from an old former slave, drinks too much one time, and even sets fire to one of the run-down shanties.

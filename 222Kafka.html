<p><span class="style18"><span class="style20"><strong>Kafka</strong>: a few quotes and  links</span></span></p>
<p class="style17">&quot;Any purely ideological 
  reading of Kafka&#133; will miss [his] most original contribution: the figuration 
  of that which dooms interpretation to failure, even a correct one&#133; Gregor&#146;s 
  abjection is&#133;more than a symptom to be read and decoded, more than a condensation 
  of social forces or contradictions, and thus more than any scapegoat figure. He 
  remains a foreign object in the text and in any interpretation.&quot; Eric Santer<br>
  <br>
&#147;That is finally what it means to be alone. To spin oneself into the silk 
  of one&#146;s own soul, to mask oneself in one&#146;s own cocoon, and wait for 
  the metamorphosis, which never fails to come about.&#148; August Strindberg<br>
  <br>
  Instead of the &#147;strange beautiful butterfly of Strindberg&#146;s fin de si&egrave;cle 
  imagination,&#148; we have &#147;a grotesque, primitive ornament of modernity: 
  the monstrous vermin.&#148; Mark Anderson <br>

  <font color="#000099">Possible interpretations of <em>The Metamorphosis </em>(from different classes over the years) </font><em><br>
  </em><br>
Gregor slides down the evolutionary ladder; there is a parody/ paradox of rationality as the biological, entomological takes over.</p>
<p class="style17"><strong>Psychological fable</strong>: a son rebelling against his father; the self is determined socially.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Marxist</strong>: alienation from capitalist culture; a father sells his children; Gregor is so conditioned to his identity of being bought and sold that he accepts his fate passively; condemnation of socialism: Gregor is like a government that provides for capable, but lazy parasites &hellip; </p>
<p class="style17"><strong>Feminist</strong>: What happens when women take the power formerly held by men?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Religious</strong>: Gregor is Jesus sacrificing himself for his family&rsquo;s sake.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Cultural/historical</strong>: impending WWII holocaust against the outsider, the Jew, the handicapped<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Formalist</strong>: hour glass structure: Meg takes Gregor&rsquo;s place in the family; optimistic or pessimistic ending <br>
    <strong><br>
  Reader response</strong>: What does the reader HOPE will happen? Will the Samsa family ever return to normal?<br>
  <br>
<strong>Queer: </strong>How does the way Gregor is treated resemble a the coming out of gay child in a homophobic family?</p>

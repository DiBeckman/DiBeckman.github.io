  by Mark Humphrey
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Algy held his daily whiskey sour and brooded.&nbsp; There are times in a man's life when trouble rears its ugly head, and the afore mentioned man must stop in his tracks and brood over the outcome of what surely must be disaster.&nbsp; Lane, Algy's butler entered and began to tidy the sitting room.&nbsp; Over the years, Lane had noticed that within ten minutes of the usual drink, Algy would begin to talk about whatever it was that bothered him.&nbsp; Today had a particularly difficult problem and Lane had given his master twenty minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's a bit thick, I mean.&quot; Algy began.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Sir?&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I mean Aunt Julia pushing this stranger onto us.&nbsp; The American chap.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Are you not inclined to have him stay, sir?&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No.&nbsp; You remember the last person she told me to put up for the week.&nbsp; That Swiss millionaire friend of hers that turned out to be a Marxist agitator.&nbsp; Nearly burnt down the flat!&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes sir, I recall the incident quite clearly.&nbsp; I believe I read recently he is currently undergoing observation at an institution. Might I take the liberty and inquire whom she wishes us to entertain, sir?&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You may well ask.&nbsp; His name is Roderick P. Simpson.&nbsp; Apparently his mum and Aunt Julia are pals.&nbsp; He's in London and the dearest A asked me to put him up for the fortnight.&nbsp; Bally nuisance.&nbsp; I heard he's some kind of playboy in the home country which means he'll be a playboy here and drag me along for the ride!&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes sir.&nbsp; During our vacation in America not long ago, I chanced to read a newspaper article devoted to the young gentleman.&nbsp; It did not speak highly of him.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I shouldn't wonder.&nbsp; He's most likely well known to the Police.&nbsp; I'll come home one evening to find its standing room only with the local constabulary.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The newspaper article I alluded to endorses your opinion, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>Lane was about to try his best to console the master when a knock was heard on the front door.&nbsp; Soon after, he returned to introduce Mr. George Wellbeloved and Lord Wittly, two of Algy's closest friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I say, what ho Algy!&quot; George beamed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;George!&nbsp; And I see you dragged out Wittly!&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord Wittly finished tripping over a small settee and joined the group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I say, I'm awfully dry, can I have one of those?&quot; Witty pointed at the whiskey sour.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Whiskey sours all 'round, Lane.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Very good, sir.&quot; Lane disappeared into the kitchen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;So young Wellbeloved, what brings you to my humble doorstep?&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well, Wittly and I are about to travel down to my Aunt's place in Cornwall.&nbsp; We had some news you might be interested in.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Cornwall?&nbsp; Why on Earth are you going there?&quot; Algy sat back down and lit a cigarette.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;My Aunt wants me to hand out the prizes and make a speech at the local school award ceremony.&nbsp; Someone must have told her about that whopping great pile of cash I won on &quot;Midnight Mistress&quot; down at Ascot.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That or your affiliation with the political party.&quot; Lord Wittly cut in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Doesn't matter.&nbsp; Anyway, I've got to make a speech and hand out horrible prizes to a horde of rug rats.&nbsp; There is a bright side though.&nbsp; Algy, do you still have the sporting blood?&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;My dear fellow, the only blood I have is sporting.&quot; Algy replied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Perfect.&nbsp; It's like this.&nbsp; After the prizes are handed out, there is a sort of festival taking place on my Aunt's estate.&nbsp; Lots of sack races, egg tosses, you get the picture.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And where is all this going?&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well, Lord Wittly and I have formed a sort of consortium with the lads down at the club.&nbsp; Nothing official, but I'll tell you that it&rsquo;s a dead certainty that little Katie Turner will win the girl's egg toss.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Are you suggesting we bet on children's games?&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well, why not?&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Right then.&nbsp; Put a couple of tenners on Katie's nose for me.&nbsp; I'm stuck in London.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What?&nbsp; We need a third person down there with ready cash! &nbsp;I could easily get you invited to my Aunt's estate!&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes, we need a third person!&nbsp; While the other two are watching the other events, the third would watch his assigned event!&quot; Lord Wittly added.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Watch for any nobling of the contestants?&nbsp; They would stoop so low in such a contest?&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Of course!&nbsp; Purity of the turf means nothing in these rural festival games.&nbsp; I imagine the bookie is already feeding chocolate to the favourite for the choirboy's ten yard dash.&nbsp; When we get there, we'll need a third to help us decide on duds and winners.&quot; George lamented. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Still, my Aunt Julia has offloaded some American blighter on me.&nbsp; I can't just leave him.&nbsp; He'll tell Aunt Julia and she'll come down like a flash.&nbsp; You know how she snarls.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What are we going to do?&quot; George flung his hands in the air.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was silence as the minds turned over the vexing problems of the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I say, I have a capital idea!&quot; Lord Wittly exclaimed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Last summer, &quot; he continued, &quot;My beastly Uncle decided to drag me with him to his annual Brighton holiday.&nbsp; At the last minute one of his old friends came down with a nasty cold, saving me from almost certain boredom.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You mean he postponed the trip to see his friend?&quot; George asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Exactly.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I think I see what you're getting at.&quot; Algy's mind began to turn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You could have a sick cousin, or uncle, or even a friend.&nbsp; Just make up someone to go see!&quot; George smiled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He would have to be a close friend.&nbsp; He's very ill.&quot; Wittly said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Lane!&quot; Algy called.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Sir?&quot; Lane appeared and handed out the needful beverages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Lane, an old friend of mine is sick.&nbsp; I'm afraid I'm going to have to go see him.&nbsp; He's come down with&hellip;.a cold.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;A very nasty cold.&nbsp; He's got frail health you know.&quot; Cut in George.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes, frail health and all that.&nbsp; I'm afraid that when Mr. Simpson arrives I shall not be able to join him in London.&nbsp; I'm sure Aunt Julia will understand?&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lane's eyebrow rose an inch.&nbsp; He looked at his master, then George, and then at Lord Wittly, who merely smiled and waved.&nbsp; A twitch on the right side of Lane's lips occurred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes sir, I shall inform Mr. Simpson and her ladyship that you have gone to see Mr&hellip;.Mr. Bunbury, a dear old friend with frail health residing in the country.&nbsp; I'm sure her ladyship will not mind you absence in light of the situation.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In York, Lane.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes sir, in York.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Thank you Lane.&nbsp; Oh, and please pack my things for a trip to the country.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes sir, I believe the tweed suit we purchased yesterday should be appropriate for travel.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Thank goodness for the ill health of Mr&hellip;.who was it again, Lane?&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Bunbury, sir.&nbsp; Your friend's name is Mr. Bunbury.&quot;</p>

<p class="style1"><span class="style2"><em>The Hollow Men </em></span><em>(scroll down for a few links to understanding and appreciating the poem.)</em><span class="style2"><em><br />
</em></span><br />
  <em>Mistah Kurtz-he dead<br />
  A penny for the Old Guy</em><br />
</p>
<p class="style12"> I</p>
<p class="style12"> We are the hollow men<br />
  We are the stuffed men<br />
  Leaning together<br />
  Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!<br />
  Our dried voices, when<br />
  We whisper together<br />
  Are quiet and meaningless<br />
  As wind in dry grass<br />
  Or rats' feet over broken glass<br />
  In our dry cellar<br />
  <br />
  Shape without form, shade without colour,<br />
  Paralysed force, gesture without motion;<br />
  <br />
  Those who have crossed<br />
  With direct eyes, to death's other Kingdom<br />
  Remember us-if at all-not as lost<br />
  Violent souls, but only<br />
  As the hollow men<br />
  The stuffed men.</p>
<p> <span class="style12"><br />
  II</span></p>
<p class="style12"> Eyes I dare not meet in dreams<br />
  In death's dream kingdom<br />
  These do not appear:<br />
  There, the eyes are<br />
  Sunlight on a broken column<br />
  There, is a tree swinging<br />
  And voices are<br />
  In the wind's singing<br />
  More distant and more solemn<br />
  Than a fading star.<br />
  <br />
  Let me be no nearer<br />
  In death's dream kingdom<br />
  Let me also wear<br />
  Such deliberate disguises<br />
  Rat's coat, crowskin, crossed staves<br />
  In a field<br />
  Behaving as the wind behaves<br />
  No nearer-<br />
  <br />
  Not that final meeting<br />
  In the twilight kingdom</p>
<p> <span class="style12"><br />
  III</span></p>
<p class="style12"> This is the dead land<br />
  This is cactus land<br />
  Here the stone images<br />
  Are raised, here they receive<br />
  The supplication of a dead man's hand<br />
  Under the twinkle of a fading star.<br />
  <br />
  Is it like this<br />
  In death's other kingdom<br />
  Waking alone<br />
  At the hour when we are<br />
  Trembling with tenderness<br />
  Lips that would kiss<br />
  Form prayers to broken stone.</p>
<p> <span class="style12"><br />
  IV</span></p>
<p class="style12"> The eyes are not here<br />
  There are no eyes here<br />
  In this valley of dying stars<br />
  In this hollow valley<br />
  This broken jaw of our lost kingdoms<br />
  <br />
  In this last of meeting places<br />
  We grope together<br />
  And avoid speech<br />
  Gathered on this beach of the tumid river<br />
  <br />
  Sightless, unless<br />
  The eyes reappear<br />
  As the perpetual star<br />
  Multifoliate rose<br />
  Of death's twilight kingdom<br />
  The hope only<br />
  Of empty men.</p>
<p> <span class="style12"><br />
  V</span></p>
<p class="style12"> <em>Here we go round the prickly pear<br />
  Prickly pear prickly pear<br />
  Here we go round the prickly pear<br />
  At five o'clock in the morning.</em><br />
  <br />
  Between the idea<br />
  And the reality<br />
  Between the motion<br />
  And the act<br />
  Falls the Shadow<br />
  <em>For Thine is the Kingdom</em><br />
  <br />
  Between the conception<br />
  And the creation<br />
  Between the emotion<br />
  And the response<br />
  Falls the Shadow<br />
  <em>Life is very long</em><br />
  <br />
  Between the desire<br />
  And the spasm<br />
  Between the potency<br />
  And the existence<br />
  Between the essence<br />
  And the descent<br />
  Falls the Shadow<br />
  <em>For Thine is the Kingdom</em><br />
  <br />
  For Thine is<br />
  Life is<br />
  For Thine is the<br />
  <em><br />
  This is the way the world ends<br />
  This is the way the world ends<br />
  This is the way the world ends<br />
  Not with a bang but a whimper.</em></p>

<p class="style1">While the poem itself is indebted to Dante's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Comedy#Inferno">Divine Comedy</a> (see especially the engravings by Gustave Dor&eacute; <a href="http://www.danshort.com/dc/page1.php?p=1">Hell</a>, <a href="http://www.danshort.com/dc/index.php?p=76">Purgatory</a> and <a href="http://www.danshort.com/dc/index.php?p=118">Paradise</a>),  it has also served as inspiration for modern artists such Francis Ford Coppola's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078788/mediaindex"><em>Apocolypse Now</em></a> (Vietnam as Joseph Conrad's Congo in <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Darkness">The Heart of Darkness</a>). </em>Listen to Marlon Brando reading <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKuA3iee4-c">&quot;The Hollow Men&quot;</a> in <em>Apocolypse Now</em>. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fu8awT5Jzs&amp;feature=related">TS Eliot</a> reads his own poem. Here's another <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KvkJdcmqek">reading</a> with WWI slides as the background.</p>

  <tr>
    <td><p align="center" class="style1">&quot;In his latest series of work Howard [Penning] has used T. S. Eliot&rsquo;s poem <em>The<br />
      Hollow Men</em> as a jumping off point to explore his own ideas around the<br />
      corporate business world. The poem seems to be an almost perfect<br />
      metaphor for the modern corporate world.</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1">The business suit becomes the symbol of a hollow man, the red &ldquo;power tie&rdquo; becomes a fatal gash. Individual personalities and voices become lost in a larger corporate identity. As the corporate world view pushes the planet closer to social, economic and environmental collapse where are the individuals who make up corporations left? Can their lives be reconciled with their jobs or do they become hollow 'yes men'?&quot;<br />

<p align="center"><em>The Metamorphosis, Resurrected </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then, independently of his will, his head sank to the floor and his last breath streamed feebly from his nostrils&rdquo;.&nbsp; The Samsa family left Gregory for dead, locked away in his filth-ridden room.&nbsp; His life, from the moment of his transformation, had proved futile.&nbsp; His family was so shallow that all traces of compassion were thrown out the window as soon as he began to change.&nbsp; He was merely a stain in the family that everyone chose to ignore; they would rather not talk about it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oddly enough, Meg gained new life with the death of her brother.&nbsp; She was revived and blossomed in his demise.&nbsp; Even before his death, she took control of the family situation and made sure that no one, not even his own parents, set eyes on his decrepit body.&nbsp; He had become inhuman, more of a bug than a man.&nbsp; Not only does Meg appear more beautiful and vibrant than before, but her, and her family&rsquo;s moods get better as well.&nbsp; Each benefits from Gregory&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What they do not realize is that Gregory did not die.&nbsp; His physical appearance might have implied the contrary, but he was merely in a state of suspended animation, a dormancy.&nbsp; When he breathed his last breath, Gregory was actually given a second chance at life; he slowly became human again.&nbsp; Although his body was in a state of living decay during the first metamorphosis, his mind was never affected.&nbsp; Bereft of the power of speech, trapped in a hideous exo-skeleton, his family did not realize was that, mentally, Gregory was completely normal.&nbsp; He was an invalid and could hardly control his movements, but his brain was functioning as it should.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after Meg locked Gregory away in his room, the entire family left the house.&nbsp; They relished in the new sense of life they had been given.&nbsp; It was as if the weight of the world had been lifted from their backs.&nbsp; No longer did they have to worry about the creature that was Gregory living in their house, locked away in a foul filth ridden room.&nbsp; As they rode the tram into the country, however, Gregory&rsquo;s body was changing yet again.&nbsp; The light shone through a small window in a room covered with feces and the remains of an old, disintegrating bed frame.&nbsp; As the sun rose higher in the afternoon sky, it crept closer and closer to the withered and cracking skin that covered Gregory&rsquo;s body.&nbsp; The door to his room slowly opened as a small puff of fresh air made its way through the apartment.&nbsp; As it hit Gregory, his flaking skin blew away as easily as a dead leaf falls from a dying tree.&nbsp; The skin that crumbled away revealed something miraculous.&nbsp; Under his old scaly shell was the skin of a human.&nbsp; It was soft, and glowed in the light that now shone on his entire body.&nbsp; The light seemed to have a rejuvenating effect on Gregory, as did the wind that was slowly uncovering his new physical appearance: that of a human. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly, Gregory&rsquo;s eyelids lifted.&nbsp; His vision was blurred and he was confused as to where he was.&nbsp; Bit by bit, he began to piece together what was happening.&nbsp; He remembered what seemed like years ago the argument amongst his family and the boarders.&nbsp; He remembered his sister taking charge when, instead of compelling his parents to care for him, she locked him away in his room to be left for dead.&nbsp; He could see now.&nbsp; It all made sense: the condition of the room, the old exoskeleton that was his skin lay scattered around him, his back was sore.&nbsp; Gregory could now move again.&nbsp; His first movement was a check of his back.&nbsp; The apple was no longer there; he was slowly healing.&nbsp; But what was this?&nbsp; A darkness crept over his vision and his head hit the floor.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gregory awoke some time later, his family still absent from the home.&nbsp; He was now able to fully control his body.&nbsp; He slowly rose from the floor and looked around.&nbsp; He was appalled at the state his room was in.&nbsp; He knew that he had been kept in it for a while, but did not realize the extent of the waste that covered the floor.&nbsp; The stench was unbearable.&nbsp; His first thought was to leave the room.&nbsp; Having regained his mobility, he was able to open the door.&nbsp; The borders, where were they?&nbsp; His last recollection of them was the argument that led to his banishment.&nbsp; He slowly moved about the house, carefully listening for any sign of other people, nothing. The house was as dead as he had seemed to be only hours ago.&nbsp; He moved to the kitchen, he hadn&rsquo;t eaten in weeks.&nbsp; Gregory devoured what was left and had sat down to contemplate what his next actions should be.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Samsa, Mrs. Samsa, and Meg felt like they never had before.&nbsp; They had taken a long walk and were returning to the apartment.&nbsp; They made their way up the stairs to the entrance to their home.&nbsp; Mr. Samsa fumbled with his keys.&nbsp; Inside, Gregory heard the commotion his father was making as he attempted to unlock the door.&nbsp; He swiftly moved to his room and quietly shut the door.&nbsp; The door to the apartment opened.&nbsp; Mr. Samsa was the first inside.&nbsp; He glanced in the kitchen and was shocked at what he saw.&nbsp; Someone had invaded their home.&nbsp; Meg&rsquo;s first reaction was to check her brother&rsquo;s room, but she was not sure why.&nbsp; She instinctively went to his door, expecting it to still be locked tight.&nbsp; She was taken aback when it opened with ease.&nbsp; What she saw was immediately burned into her memory forever.&nbsp; She screamed.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Samsa rushed to their daughter&rsquo;s aide.&nbsp; A body rushed toward them and everything went quiet.&nbsp; Mr. Samsa&rsquo;s last sight was the door to Gregory&rsquo;s room slowly closing.&nbsp; He heard the sound of the cold steel locking him away just before the pungent smell of the room burned his nostrils as his last breath slowly flowed out of his body.	</p>

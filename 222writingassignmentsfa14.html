  <p>*This and all subsequent references to Shannon are from Edward Shannon's <span class="text">The Prentice Hall Guide to Writing about Literature</span> (Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2002) which went out of print in 2010. I  replaced it with <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> as a textbook for our class. Details about what he means by &quot;confusing, repeated, familiar and strange&quot; can be found <a href="222Shannonmore.html">here</a>.</p>
  <p>Write a one-paragraph to one-page summary of Chapter 1 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span>. Include the title of each chapter in your heading, since   it should reflect the main point of the chapter. Your summary should include the main points and any others that seem especially helpful or surprising to you. Some students prefer to an outline format or question format. (See <a href="222ShortGuideSample.pdf">this example</a> of a question format and <a href="222ASGoutline.pdf">this example</a> of an outline format.) Outlining, writing questions, and summarizing are all useful skills. You may handwrite or type it, and you may include it on the same page with your discussion of the first stanza of <span class="text">Essay on Man. </span>You may submit<span class="text"> A Short Guide</span> assignments electronically since I will not make extensive comments on them. If they are submitted electronically, they will be returned to you electronically. </p>
  <p> Print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222Enlightenment.html">The Enlightenment</a> and <a href="222GreatChain.html">The Great Chain of Being</a> if you want to use them to take notes.</p>
<p>In addition, for this and the next assignment, take a look at  my web page on <a href="Explication.html"><em>Explication de Texte</em></a> and these web sites about figures of speech which are also listed on the handy <a href="222supmatf04.html">Supplementary Materials</a> page. These pages will  be useful for your <a href="222poetrypresentation.html">Poetry Presentation</a> due on <span class="date">September 12 and 15.</span></p>

    <li>Here is <a href="http://grammar.about.com/od/terms/a/revquiz20terms.htm?p=1">a quiz</a> you can take to assess your knowledge of the &quot;Top 20 figures of speech&quot; by Richard Norquist.</li>
    <li> <a href="http://www.nipissingu.ca/faculty/williams/figofspe.htm">This site</a> contains figures of speech, thought, repetition, more than you can shake a stick at! Most examples are drawn from Shakespeare. </li>
    <li> <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/rhetoricaldevicesinsound.htm">This site</a> is very cool because it has sound clips and draws from a wide range of speeches, movies, and more to illustrate the Figures of Speech. For example, see and listen to quotes from Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln, and Neil Armstrong on <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/figures/antithesis.htm">the page about antitheses</a>.</li>

  <ol>
    <li>Read <span class="text">Essay on Man</span> and write a page about your stanza to turn in. In case you're not sure what a <em>stanza</em> is, you can look this and other literary terms up in our course <a href="222Glossary.html">Glossary</a>, the Glossary in Appendix B of <span class="text">A Short Guide to Writing About Literature</span>, or a web site such as <a href="http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms.html">http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms.html</a>. <br />
      <br />
Note that the Roman numerals I-X at the beginning of each stanza correspond to your assigned stanza number (not a page or line number). What is the stanza about? Give a one-sentence summary. Answer  Shannon's 4 questions. Also, what are the key words and images in the stanza? How does the stanza connect with the ideas of the Enlightenment we've discussed? What is  the attitude of the narrator? What is the role of nature, especially animals, if any appear in your stanza?</li>
    <li>Write a one-paragraph to one-page summary or outline of Chapter 2 in <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> to turn in. Take, correct, and turn in your answers to the Quiz in Appendix B  364-371 of <span class="text">A Short Guide.</span></li>

<h2 class="class">Class 5 (Voltaire, Lecture 2) <span class="date">due Friday, August 29</span></h2>
<ul><li> Discuss the following questions after you do the reading assignment (Chapters 14-22). Quote from the text with examples to support your answers and include the page reference for each quotation.
          <ul>
            <li>Is Eldorado a genuine utopia or (in one critic's words) &quot;a colossal bore&hellip;satirized by Voltaire as foolish and futile&quot;?</li>
            <li>Which specific behaviors or institutions show us that Voltaire wants the reader to see Eldorado as utopic?</li>
            <li>Does Voltaire have a philosophical lesson in mind or is it pure satire? Or both?</li>
            <li>How does it correspond to your personal view of Utopia?</li></ul>
        </li>
</ul>
<ul><li>See Lecture Notes on <a href="222dulce.html">Dulce et utile</a>.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Read Chapter 3 in <em>A Short Guide</em> and write a summary to turn in.</li></ul>
 <ul><li>The first original contribution post&mdash;on Pope&mdash;is due <span class="date">tonight</span> at midnight. You will have many authors to choose from to do your required 14 posts (7 original contributions and 7 responses), but I encourage you to get in the habit of posting by starting with Pope or Voltaire. For an original contribution post, make a point or develop an argument of at least <span class="red">one  full paragraph (5-8 sentences)</span> based on something you read, learned or thought while reading <em>An Essay on Man</em>. Ask a question or make a provocative statement for your classmates to respond to. You may also include a quote from the text under discussion or links to other web sites. Did something in your homework get praise or a lot of comment from me? If so, it might be the basis of a good post.</li></ul>
          <h2><span class="class">Class 6 (Voltaire, Lecture 3)</span> <span class="date">due Wednesday, September 3</span></h2>
          <p>Read the page in Supplementary Materials, <a href="Candide%20quotes.html">Quotes from different critics about &quot;Il faut cultiver notre jardin.&quot;</a> Write a page which includes answers to the following questions: what are some  literal and figurative meanings of the word <em>garden</em>? How do they apply to Candide's garden? How do <strong>you</strong> interpret the final line of the story? </p>
          <p>To help you to understand the difference between <strong>literal</strong> and <strong>figurative</strong>, here is  an example I found online:</p>
<blockquote>
            <p><strong>literal</strong> vs. <strong>figurative</strong> meaning - relates to the meanings of words and phrases or expressions. For example, &quot;She was all ears&quot; has a <strong>figurative</strong> meaning (She was listening intently) as well as a <strong>literal</strong> meaning (Her body was composed of ears or she had a huge set of ears). <span class="citation"><a href="http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm">Literary Terms for English</a></span></p>

  <li>Choose any one of the following questions to answer and<strong> include the question </strong>with your answer. These questions would also inspire some good discussions in your Moodle posts.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
  <div class="maroon">
    <h3>FORMALIST CRITICISM:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>How do the names of individual characters tie into the main messages within <em>Madame Bovary</em>?  Are the names meant to hold hidden significance (Leon could be lion, Justin could be justice, Rodolphe could be rodent, etc.)? </li>
      <li>How does Flaubert's use of free indirect discourse reinforce the overall meaning of the story? Is it simply stylistic or does it enhance the meaning? </li>
      <li>Flaubert alters the tempo throughout <em>Madame Bovary</em>, by briefly mentioning certain events and going into great length on others. What is the purpose of this and how does this benefit the story?</li>
      <li>Does Emma's taste in literature have a specific connection to the plot of <em>Madame Bovary</em>?  If so, what is the significance of these allusions and how do they enhance the plot?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h3>SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
  <div class="red">
    <h4>Marxist Criticism:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>How does the economic status of Charles, Emma, Rodolphe, Lheureux, and Homais affect each character socially, emotionally, and politically?</li>
      <li>Which social class is Flaubert frustrated with and how does he portray this in the story?</li>
      <li>In <em>Madame Bovary</em>, who represents the proletariat social class and who represents the bourgeoisie? What affect do these social classes have on the characters' views on themselves in society?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="purple">
    <h4>Feminist Criticism: </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Would Emma still be existentially bored and frustrated if she were a man? Would her manner of dealing with her problems change in any way?</li>
      <li>Had Madame Bovary lived in 2014, what gender specific issues do you think she would face today? Would they be completely different from what she faced in the story or would there be similarities? </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="teal">
    <h3>CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>How is French culture reflected in<em> Madame Bovary</em>? How different would this book be if the setting was in a different country?</li>
      <li>What would Emma do/How would she react if she was suddenly moved down (or up) a class level? That is to say, if she were to become very very poor, or very very rich and influential instead of her current middle class life?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="orange">
    <h3>PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In <em>Madame Bovary, </em>what examples from the text suggest that Emma may actually be suffering from a mental illness? Which mental illness do you think this is and why? </li>
      <li>Charles' mother, Madame Bovary, is very opinionated. She frequently injects herself into Charles and Emma's marriage. Madame Bovary is jealous of the love, attention, and money Charles spends on Emma. She insists Emma stop spending so much money, and stop filling her mind with ridiculous romantic novels. What does this invasive relationship say about the author and his personal psychological state in regard to his relationship with mother-figures? What type of psychological effect does this strenuous mother/son relationship create and what are the real life consequences? Does the author consider this type of relationship to be normal, or is he making an example out of it? </li>
      <li>Why was Emma so unsuccessful in marriage? Was she fated to be unsuccessful because of her obsession with emotions evidenced from a young age, or did her infatuation with romantic novels set her up for failure?</li>
      <li>After learning his personal background and studying the way Gustave Flaubert puts parts of his own personality into his writing, do any of the characters or aspects of characters appear to be constructed around himself or his own life?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="blue">
    <h3>READER RESPONSE CRITICISM:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Who was <em>Madame Bovary</em>'s iintended audience? To what extent are you similar or dissimilar to that audience?</li>
      <li>How does Emma's actions and dialogue affect your understanding of reality? </li>
      <li>How would you identify and interpret Charles' character throughout his relationship with Emma?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="green">
    <h3>ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>How do the opposite settings of the countryside, and the city (two places Emma lived in) compare, symbolize, and/or relate to Emma and Charles's relationship?  How does this relate to Emma's emotions and mixed feelings throughout the book?</li>
      <li>In what way(s) does Emma's environment contribute to her desires?</li>
      <li>How does the setting in Madame Bovary influence the characters, and how do changes in setting correspond to the plot and the decisions the characters make?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="fuchsia">
    <h3>QUEER THEORY: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Thus far in the novel we have found several relationships involving Emma. The relationship between Emma and Leon is mostly emotional, the relationship between Emma and Rodolphe is mostly sexual, and the relationship between Emma and Charles is an absence of both of these traits. Why do you think Flaubert takes these relationships to extremes, and how does it relate to the theme of love?</li>
    </ul>

<p>After finishing the story,  answer your own question, or another student's (see below), based on the <strong>whole</strong> story. In other words, how might we interpret the <span class="text">Metamorphosis</span> through the lens of Formalist, Marxist, Feminist&hellip; criticism? Think especially about the violin scene, the death scene and the final paragraph. </p>
<p>For fun, <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~ljordan/metamorphosis/"> check out</a>: Which character are you in The Metamorphosis? </p>
<p>&quot;We are all sentenced to solitary confinement inside our own skins, for life.&quot; Tennessee Williams. Recommended reading: two articles  relate to what I'll call <a href="222Isolationandcontact.html">The Gerasim Effect</a>&mdash;<span class="text">The United States holds tens of thousands of inmates in long-term solitary confinement. Is this torture?</span> by Atul Gawande  and <span class="text">Comforter and Comforted in an Unfolding Mystery</span> by Nell Burger Kirst. These articles could lead to a potential paper topic.</p>
<div class="maroon">
  <h3>FORMALIST CRITICISM:</h3>
 
  <ul><li>Is there a reason that Kafka divided this text into numerical sections? What is the significance of it?  </li>
 <li>Why does the first sentence contain what could be described as the climax of the story?</li>
    <li>What is the significance of the &quot;monstrous vermin&quot; metaphor? What could it represent? What is its purpose?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h3>SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
<div class="red">
  <h4>Marxist Criticism:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>If Gregor were not forced to be a traveling salesman, a job he despises, what significance do you think him turning into a bug would have? Would he have turned into something more &quot;able bodied&quot; than a beetle that cannot turn over or scratch itself?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="purple">
  <h4>Feminist Criticism: </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>How would Gregor's life be different if he were a female? How does his relationship with his parents differ from that of his sister?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="teal">
  <h3>CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Some argue that <em>The Metamorphosis</em> portrays the soldier&rsquo;s feelings post World War I. &nbsp;How does Gregor&rsquo;s transformation and qualities directly pertain to the war and society&rsquo;s response to it?</li>
    <li>How might this story been affected if it was written in the present day as opposed to 1915? If the story were made in a movie then versus now, would the plot be diminished by the gory and severe special effects used in movies today or would it be enhanced? Also, if it was made into a movie, would that diminish the effect of creating your own mental image of Gregor as the vermin or enhance it?<strong></strong></li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="orange">
  <h3>PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>In the beginning, the main character is waking up from dream. What can the rest of the story tell you about Gregor Samsa&rsquo;s unconscious desires, fears and unresolved conflicts and do you Gregor Samsa ever woke up from his dream?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="blue">
  <h3>READER RESPONSE CRITICISM:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>To what extent can the reader connect with Gregor's situation in  <em>Metamorphosis</em>? </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="green">
  <h3>ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Besides the rain that we briefly see outside, ths environment that we are exposed to in the first half of the story is in Gregor's room. How does the room shape the first part of the story?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="fuchsia">
  <h3>QUEER THEORY: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
    How does the way Gregor is treated resemble the coming out of a gay child in a homophobic family?</li></ul></div>

<h2><span class="class">Class 35 (Thesis exercise and Peer review of Term Paper proposal) </span><span class="date">due Monday, November 17</span></h2>
<p>The first part of class will be devoted to <em>The Thesis Exercise</em>. Read the <a href="222Thesis exercise.html">web page</a> about how to write a thesis for a literary paper. Print and fill out the <a href="222Theses.html">page of sample FL 222 theses</a> where you rate the examples. The second half of class will be devoted to peer review of the first pre-draft of your <a href="222Paper2010.html">Paper</a>. Print out <strong>two copies</strong> of the <a href="Peerevaluation2.pdf">Peer Review Feedback Form</a> to include with the <strong>two copies</strong> of your draft which you will bring for your classmates. Fill out the top part of the form with your name, paper title, and date. Do <strong>not wait</strong> until the last minute to print these materials out. Email me before class if you have an idea for your own original topic so that I can approve it. Speaking of original, a very creative paper where almost all the main characters meet in Hell written by a former student is featured <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~dsbeckma/To Hell with Literature.htm"> here</a>, and my favorite missing chapter of <em>Candide</em> is <a href="222VoltaireCandide.html">here</a>. The complete first draft will be due to me on <span class="date">Monday, November 24</span>.</p>
<p>Selected writing advice from the <a href="222Paper2010.html">Term Paper page:</a></p>
<p>Read through the topic choices below. Consult Chapter 10 in <span class="text"> A Short Guide, Writing about Fiction: the World of the Story</span>, especially the pages on &quot;Getting Ideas&quot; (171-5).  Which texts have been your favorite or challenged you the most? Send me an email or make an appointment if you need help deciding on a topic. <span class="red">If you are doing a creative project, you will not have a <strong>thesis </strong>per se in your rough draft, but you will replace that with a <strong>story premise </strong>that explains what the goal of your project is and how it relates to the text(s) you are responding to. </span></p>
<h2>Paper Topics</h2>
<p><strong>A. Critical creative rewriting</strong></p>
<p>You become the author/artist. Take one of your favorite stories, poems or plays and imagine what happens to the characters after the story ends. You could also rewrite the story before it starts or focus on an important scene from a <em>different</em> character's point of view: Cun&eacute;gonde's, Berthe's or Gerasim's&hellip; One student rewrote Pope's <span class="text">Essay on Man</span> in the format of Baudelaire's &quot;Enivirez-vous.&quot; You could also write a letter from one character to another in the same story or a different story. For example: What advice would Rodolphe give Ashenbach? For a model, see <a href="http://grammar.about.com/od/classicessays/a/franklinmis.htm">Ben Franklin's letter of &quot;Advice on Choosing a Mistress</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the author's narrative style, plot, characterization, vocabulary and imagery, so that you can imitate it (or even make a parody of it). If you use direct quotes from the original text, put these passages <em>in italics. </em>Include the page reference for your quote. Do not include historical anachronisms, such as a telephone in <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> or snooze button on Gregor's alarm clock.</p>
<p> The <strong>creative</strong> part of the paper should be two to three pages long. </p>
<p>The second half of the paper will be the <strong>critical </strong>portion: a writing journal or commentary. It should also be a minimum of three pages long for the final version. Explain the stages of your project: first, the choice of story or character, next, the problems and reflections you had while rewriting, including all the ideas you came up with and rejected and the reasons why. Some of the other ideas may lead to other projects later and it is good to have a record of them. Finally, include what you learned about your author and text and the process of writing. For example, what did you notice about your author's style when you read the story for class? What did you notice for the first time during or after class? How did your observation or appreciation of his/her style change as you worked on imitating it? For specifics, be sure to mention the criteria listed <a href="222ImitateStyle.html">here</a>.  The writing journal portion of this paper  is one of the rare occasions in a college paper where it is appropriate to use &quot;I,&quot; as you recount your experience as a writer. </p>
<p>In other words, your <em>rewrite</em> is your <strong>response</strong> to a text. Your <em>commentary</em> is the <strong>reflection</strong> on that response. For the peer review draft, you should include a page of your rewriting and a page of commentary, perhaps an outline. You will not have a thesis, per se, but you should have a <strong>very clear story idea or premise for alternative art project</strong>. Date entries in your writer's journal. Each time you get new input, such as your peer reviews and your instructor review,  revise your creative section, and add to the journal section to reflect the new issues raised by the reviewers. </p>
<p>You can  read the stories written by students in previous semesters <a href="222CreativeWriting.htm">here</a>. An amazing example which includes the majority of characters studied in FL 222 is <em><a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~dsbeckma/To Hell with Literature.htm">To Hell With Literature</a> </em>(Joey Schopper, Fall 2006).</p>
<p>Need a name for a character in your creative story? To get the nationality right, check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_given_names">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_given_names</a></p>
<p><strong>B. Compare and contrast</strong> at least 2 texts from 2 different authors, including one 
  from the second half of the semester. <span class="red">Use the following comments as a <strong>guide</strong> to develop <strong>your own thesis</strong>. You do not need to answer all of them; you <strong>do</strong> need to have a coherent thesis.  Reminder: an thesis is not a topic, fact or opinion. It is an argument.</span> You may also choose your own topic. (See D below.)</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>The Function of Setting in</strong>&#133; (Tolstoy, Woolf, Kafka, Joyce, Brecht, 
    Camus&#133;)
    Discuss how the setting in these texts contributes to the main theme. Include 
    such issues as the history, particular location, spatial relations and the meaning 
    of movement from one space to another, the social meaning of space and place, 
    etc.</li>
  <li><strong> Illness, Disease and Death in</strong>&#133; (Flaubert, Tolstoy, Joyce, Mann, 
    Kafka&#133;) Describe how the authors represent illness, disease, and death, 
    and how these themes function in the texts. Pay attention to the societal aspects 
    of disease and death. Recommended reading&mdash;two articles  related to what I call <a href="222Isolationandcontact.html">The Gerasim Effect</a>&mdash;<em>The United States holds tens of thousands of inmates in long-term solitary confinement. Is this torture?</em> by Atul Gawande  and <em>Comforter and Comforted in an Unfolding Mystery</em> by Nell Burger Kirst. </li>
  <li><strong> The representation of gender roles in</strong>&#133;What positions do men and women occupy in society? What is expected of them because of their gender? What limitations does their gender impose? How does it shape romantic love? What are the differences between married love and romantic love that are portrayed? You may end with a comparison to contemporary gender roles.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>C. Text and Film/ Theater</strong>. See a filmed version of one of the texts we have read 
  in class or attend one of the plays performed locally this semester. Films can be viewed online or at DH Hill (see <a href="https://reserves.lib.ncsu.edu/"> reserve</a> holdings for our class). Write an analysis comparing the two&#151;consider how reading 
  and watching film are different. For example, <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span>, &quot;The Dead,&quot; &quot;The Lady with a Dog,&quot; &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest,&quot; and <span class="text">Death in Venice</span> have all been made into films. Your thesis should focus your evaluation of how the filmed version relates to the text version. Is it a successful, weak or failed adaptation? Is it a respectful hommage? A brilliant or flawed reworking of the original? </p>
<p> Here are some questions to think about: </p>
<ul>
  <li>What scenes were left out and what scenes were added? How did these changes 
    improve or detract from the story? You might want to concentrate on one element 
    or even one scene, such as the ending.</li>
  <li>How would you rate the director and the 
    choice of cast? Did the actors who played the roles in the film conform to your 
    expectations?</li>
  <li>How does the use of language, or the way certain actors behave, 
    imply a whole range of characteristics described in words in the book?</li>
  <li>Did the 
    director set the right tone for the film?</li>
  <li>How is seeing a play performed different than reading it?</li>
</ul>
<p>See &quot;Getting Ideas for Writing about a Film Based on a Work of Literature&quot; (176-78) or &quot;Getting Ideas for Writing about a Film Based on a Play&quot; (216-20) in <span class="text"> A Short Guide</span>.</p>
<p>If you are using a novel that has been remade into film several times, you might 
  want to consider the same scene in more than one version and think about time-related 
  choices. For instance, <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> has been remade in almost every decade 
  of the 20th century, incuding versions by Jean Renoir in 1933, Vincent Minnelli in 1949, and Claude Chabrol in 1991.  The emphasis in the films is different in part because 
  each reflects its own time and the ideas of its director.</p>
<p>See <span class="text">A Short Guide</span> (339) to cite a film or DVD. A useful site to find important quotes from movies: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Search/quotes">http://www.imdb.com/Search/quotes</a>. It is also often useful to listen to the director's commentary, if you are using a DVD with this feature.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> You may also propose <strong>your own topic</strong> as long as it is a <strong>comparison</strong>.  Your proposed topic must be submitted 
  to me for approval by the date of the peer review.</p>
<p>Sample topics from previous semesters: Blake's &quot;London&quot; and Wordsworth's &quot;Composed on Westminster Bridge&quot;; Autumn poems by Keats, Baudelaire, Verlaine and Auden; Death-bed scenes in Dickinson's 465 &quot;I heard a Fly buzz&quot; or 712 &quot;Because I could not stop for Death,&quot; and Emma's death scene in <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> or Ivan's in <span class="text">The Death of Ivan Ilyich</span>; <span class="text">Candide</span> and <span class="text">Forrest Gump</span>; Utopias in <span class="text">Candide</span> and <span class="text">The Village</span>; <span class="text">Wedding Crashers</span> and <span class="text">The Importance of Being Earnest</span>; <span class="text">Slumdog Millionaire</span> and <span class="text">Madame Bovary</span> or <span class="text">Candide</span>; &quot;A Room of One's Own&quot; and Michael Cunningham's <span class="text"> The Hours;</span> <em>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</em> and Abrom's <span class="text">Tuesdays with Morrie</span>; <a href="222ASG14.html">Paintings and Poems</a>&hellip; The list goes on&hellip;</p>

  </b>Has its 
  roots in <font color="#FF0000">Expressionism</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Surrealism</font> 
  as well as the fiction of Joyce and Kafka; emerged after World War II as a rebellion 
  against the essential beliefs and values of traditional culture and literature 
  and the assumption that man is a rational creature who lives in a partially 
  intelligible universe, that he is part of an orderly social structure, and that 
  he is capable of heroism and dignity, even in defeat. <br>
  <br>
  Camus, <i>The Myth of Sisyphus</i>: &#147;In a universe that is suddenly deprived 
  of illusions and light, man feels a stranger. His is an irremediable exile&#133;This 
  divorce between man and his life, the actor and his setting, truly constitutes 
  the feeling of Absurdity.&#148;<br>

  Ionesco in an essay on Kakfa: &#147;Cut off from his religious, metaphysical 
  and transcendental roots, man is lost; all his actions become senseless, absurd, 
  useless.&#148; <b><font color="#006600"><br>

  <strong><font color="#FF0000">Aestheticism</font></strong><br>
  19th century <font color="#FF0000">aestheticism</font> holds that art should be independent of social, political, or moral teaching. Hence the doctrine of <em>l'art pour l'art</em> (see <font color="#FF0000">Art for Art's Sake</font> below), a concept derived from the philosopher Immanuel Kant as well as Edgar Allan Poe's argument that the supreme poem is one written for its own sake. Aestheticism was headquartered in France with Baudelaire and Walter Pater in England. </p>
<p class="style26">&bull; &quot;There is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well-written, or badly written, that is all.&quot; </p>
<p class="style26">&bull; &quot;It is through Art, and through Art only, that we can shield ourselves from the sordid perils of actual existence.&quot; </p>
<p class="style26">&bull; &quot;In matters of grave importance, style not sincerity, is the most crucial thing.&quot; </p>
<p class="style26"><em>Oscar Wilde</em><br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="#FF0000">Allusion</font></strong><br> 
in a work of literature is a reference, explicit or implicit, to a person, place, or event or to another literary work or passage.</p>
<p class="style26"><b><font color="#FF0000"><b>Art 
  for Art&#146;s Sake</b></font> 
  <br>
  </b>In defiance 
  of society&#146;s expectation that art should have usefulness and social value, 
  French symbolist writers argue that art is supremely valuable because it has 
  no goal beyond its own existence; it exists only to be beautiful: art for art&#146;s 
  sake. <br>
  The artist is a priest who renounces the practical and self-seeking concerns 
  of ordinary existence in the service of what Flaubert and others called &#147;the 
  religion of beauty.&#148;<br>

<p class="style26"><font color="#FF0000"><b>Autobiography</b></font><br>
  Written by the subject about him/herself. <br>
  Emphasis on developing self. Often: mental crisis and recovery, discovery of 
  identity and vocation<br>
  St. Augustine, Confessions (14th cent.), Wordsworth, <em>The Prelude</em><br>
  Benjamin Franklin<br>
  question of reliability: systematic development of a self-image?<br>
  creation of a mythology of self?<br>
  posing / acting?<br>
  self-glorification?<br>

  <font color="#FF0000"><b>Bildungsroman</b></font> <br>
  - German term for &#147;educational novel&#148; or &#147;novel of formation&#148; 
  <br>
  - subject is the development of the protagonist&#146;s mind and character, as 
  s/he passes from childhood through varied experiences&#151;and usually through 
  a spiritual crisis&#151;into maturity and the recognition of his/her identity 
  and role in the world. </p>
<p class="style26"><strong><font color="#FF0000">Black humor<br>
</font></strong>In literature and drama, combining the morbid and grotesque with humor and farce to give a disturbing effect and convey the absurdity and cruelty of life.</p>
<p class="style26"><font color="#FF0000"><b>Bovarysme</b></font>: 
      title of book by Jules de Gautier (1902). It is the habit of conceiving ourselves 
      other than we are; the practice of imagining life as more perfect than it can 
      be and then being bored or angry and rejecting it; characters who attempt to 
      take the desires of other people (or other characters) as their own, seeing 
      them as models to imitate.</p>
<p class="style26"><strong><font color="#FF0000">Characters </font></strong>can be discussed in a number of ways.<br>
&bull;	The <font color="#FF0000">protagonist</font> is the main character, who is not necessarily a hero or a heroine. The <font color="#FF0000">antagonist</font> is the opponent; the antagonist may be society, nature, a person, or an aspect of the protagonist. The antihero, a recent type, lacks or seems to lack heroic traits.<br>
&bull;	A <font color="#FF0000">persona</font> is a fictional character. Sometimes the term means the mask or <font color="#FF0000">alter-ego</font> of the author; it is often used for first person works and lyric poems, to distinguish the writer of the work from the character in the work. <br>
&bull;	Characters may be classified as <em>round</em> (three-dimensional, fully developed) or as <em>flat</em> (having only a few traits or only enough traits to fulfill their function in the work); as developing (dynamic) characters or as static characters. <br>
&bull; A <font color="#FF0000">foil</font> is a secondary character who contrasts with a major character; in Hamlet, Laertes and Fortinbras, whose fathers have been killed, are foils for Hamlet.<br>

<p class="style26"><strong><font color="#FF0000">Conscience</font><br>
</strong>1. The awareness of a moral or ethical aspect to one's conduct together with the urge to prefer right over wrong.</p>
<p class="style26">2. The part of the superego that judges the ethical nature of one's actions and thoughts and then transmits such determinations to the ego for consideration.</p>
<p class="style26"><font color="#FF0000"><b>Counterpoint<br>
  </b></font>The technique of combining 
            two or more melodic lines in such a way that they establish a harmonic relationship 
  while retaining their linear individuality.  </p>
<p class="style26"><span class="style32">Dada<br>
</span>Dada or Dadaism is a cultural movement that began in Z&uuml;rich, Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1922. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature&mdash;poetry, art manifestoes, art theory&mdash;theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti-war politics through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works. Its purpose was to ridicule what its participants considered to be the meaninglessness of the modern world. In addition to being anti-war, dada was also anti-bourgeois and anarchistic in nature. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada"><span class="style33"><span class="style24">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada</span></span></a><br>
  <br>
  <b><font color="#FF0000"><b>Decadence</b></font></b> 
  <br>
  The 
      thoroughly <font color="#FF0000">Decadent</font> writer cultivates high artifice 
      in style and the bizarre in subject matter, recoils from the fertility and exuberance 
      of instinctual and organic life, prefers elaborate dress over the living form 
      and cosmetics over natural hue. Sometimes sets out to violate what is &#147;natural&#148; 
  in human experience by resorting to drugs, depravity or sexual deviation in 
  the attempt to achieve &#147;the systematic derangement of all the senses&#148; (Rimbaud). <br>

  <br>
  <font color="#FF0000"><b>Defamilarization</b></font><font color="#000000"><br>
  Art exists so we may recover the sensation of life as it is seen, perceived, 
  not as it is known. The artist must increase the difficulty and length of the 
  experience of perception. The role of art is to defamiliarize: to make things 
  seem unfamiliar rather than automatic; to make us see things as if we were seeing 
  them for the first time. <br>
  <i>Viktor Shklovsky, Russian Formalist movement in the early 1920s. </i></font><br>
  <br>

  <strong><font color="#FF0000">Essay</font></strong><br>
A genre of literature. The essay is a short literary composition on a single theme, often presenting the personal opinions of the author. The essay is a very pliable genre, and can even read like a short story; however, an essay is understood to be a work of nonfiction, whereas a short story is understood to be fiction&hellip;The essay is often used to make arguments and to persuade an audience to accept one point of view over another regarding the issue at hand. </p>
<p align="left" class="style26"> <font color="#FF0000"><b>Expressionism</b></font><br>
  In Germany, between 1910 and 1925. Precursors in painting: Van Gogh, Gauguin 
  and Munch; in literature: Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Dostoevsky, and Nietzsche.<br>
  <br>
  Radical revolt against subject matter and style of<font color="#FF0000"> Realism. 
  </font> Artist presents a troubled or intensely emotional vision of human life 
  and human society by violently exaggerating and distorting objective features 
  of the outer world and embodying extremes of mood and feeling. Man often stands 
  alone and afraid in an industrial, technological, and urban society which is 
  disintegrating into chaos. In fiction, standard modes of characterization and 
  plot are abandoned for symbolic figures involved in a dream-world of nightmarish 
  events. <br>

<p align="left" class="style26"><font color="#FF0000"><b>Irony:</b></font><br>
  <b>Verbal irony</b>: a statement in which the implicit meaning is different 
        from what the speaker asserts. <br>
  <b>Dramatic irony</b>: the audience shares with the author knowledge of which 
        a character is ignorant: the character acts in a way grossly inappropriately 
        to the actual circumstances, or expects the opposite of what fate holds in store, 
        or says something the anticipates the actual outcome, but not at all in the

  <br>
  Literature: three major trends:<br>
  1) Literature of perception: (Joyce, Proust, Woolf)<br>
  May be hard to read: the reader is disoriented. The story can only be told through 
  the consciousness of a character. Rejection of omniscent narrator.<br>
  <br>
  2) Literature of the absurd: (Tolstoy, Kafka, Camus)<br>
  Easy to read. Parody of the use of realistic techniques: causality is absent 
  or illogical. The universe doesn&#146;t make sense.<br>
  <br>
  3) Literature of exile (Joyce, Kafka, Camus)<br>
  Many modernist writers live in Paris; sense of exile and subjectivity; if not 
  literal, physical exile, then inner exile.</p>
<p class="style26">Focus on language 
  itself, writing about writing.<br>

  <br>
  <font color="#FF0000"><b>Ode</b></font><br>
  An ode is a long, lyric poem, serious in subject, elevated in style and elaborate 
  in its stanzaic structure&#133; The irregular ode allows each stanza to establish 
  its own pattern of varying line lengths, number of lines and rhyme scheme. This 
  type has been the most common for the English Ode; Wordsworth&#146;s great &#147;Ode: 
  Intimations of Immortality&#148; is representative&#133; Romantic poets preferred 
  the personal ode of description and passionate meditation, which is stimulated 
  by an aspect of the outer scene and turns on the attempt to solve either a private 
  problem or a generally human one.<br>
  Abrams, <i>A Glossary of Literary Terms</i>.<br>
  <br>
<strong><font color="#FF0000">Parable</font><br>
</strong>A short simple story illustrating a moral lesson. In a parable the story is developed not for its own sake but only in so far as it reinforces the moral, which is always explicit. The parables of Christ, such as those of the Good Samaritan and the Prodigal Son, are the most famous of this genre.<br>

<br>
<strong><font color="#FF0000">Parody</font></strong><br>
A literary work that imitates another work in order to ridicule it. Usually this ridicule is achieved through exaggeration of style and structure. </p>
<p class="style26">  <font color="#FF0000"><b>Pathetic Fallacy</b></font><br>
&quot;A phrase originated by Ruskin in <i>Modern Painters</i>, Vol. III, Part 
    IV (1856) to describe the attribution of human characteristics to inanimate 
    objects. Such an attribution usually falls short of a full personification. 
    Quoting a phrase from Kinglsey, &quot;the cruel, crawling foam,&quot; Ruskin 
    said, &quot;The foam is not cruel, not does it crawl&#133;All violent feelings&#133;produce 
    in use a falseness in all our impressions of external things, which I would 
    characterize as the 'Pathetic Fallacy'. &quot;<br>
  <br>
  Ruskin qualified his condemnation by admitting that examples of the pathetic 
fallacy, though false to nature, were often were beautiful. This phenomenon, 
he argued, was usually found in poets whom he placed in the second rank (such 
as Wordsworth, Coleridge, Tennyson) whose who felt strongly but thought weakly. 
Great poets, who both felt and thought strongly, would not so distort nature 
unless, under the stress of prophetic inspiration, they were attempting to express 
something so incomparably above them that no human mind could perceive it truly. 
Though this distinction in the use of the pathetic fallacy has been criticized 
as dubiously subjective, Ruskin's term has remained useful. Today, however, 
it is descriptive and carries no pejorative connotations.&quot; <br>

<p class="style26"><strong><font color="#FF0000">Stanza</font></strong><br>
  In poetry, a stanza is a unit within a larger poem. In modern poetry, the term is often equivalent with strophe; in popular vocal music, a stanza is typically referred to as a &quot;verse&quot; (as distinct from the refrain, or &quot;chorus&quot;).<br>
  <br>
  A stanza consists of a grouping of lines, set off by a space, that usually has a set pattern of meter and rhyme.<br>
  <br>
In traditional English-language poems, stanzas can be identified and grouped together because they share a rhyme scheme or a fixed number of lines (as in distich/couplet, tercet, quatrain, cinquain/quintain, sestet). In much modern poetry, stanzas may be arbitrarily presented on the printed page because of publishing conventions that employ such features as white space or punctuation.<br>

      A rebellion against all restraints on free artistic creativity, including logical 
      reason, standard morality, social and artistic conventions and norms, and control 
      by forethought and intention. Uses automatic writing, dream material, states 
      of mind between sleep and waking and natural or artificially induced hallucinations.

<p class="style26"><font color="#FF0000"><strong>The Symbolist Movement<br>
</strong></font>A school of French writers, beginning with Baudelaire and continuing with Rimbaud, Verlaine, Mallarm&eacute;, Val&eacute;ry. Baudelaire based the symbolic mode of his poems on the writings of Poe, and especially on the ancient doctrine of <strong>correspondences</strong>, or inherent analogy, between the mind and the outer world, as well as between the natural and the spiritual world; as Baudelaire put it: &quot;Everything, form, movement, number, color, perfume, in the <em>spiritual</em> as in the <em>natural</em> world, is significative, reciprocal, converse, <em>correspondent</em>.&quot; The techniques of the French Symbolists, who exploited private symbols in a poetry of rich suggestiveness rather than explicit signification, had an immense influence.<br>

<p class="style26"><strong><font color="#FF0000">Uncanny<br>
</font></strong>&quot;Peculiarly unsettling, as if of supernatural origin or nature; eerie&quot;</p>
<p class="style26">According to Freud, the uncanny derives its terror not from something externally alien or unknown but&mdash;on the contrary&mdash;from something strangely familiar which defeats our efforts to separate ourselves from it. Freud explains that an author can cause an uncanny response in the reader by straddling the line between reality and unreality within the work of fiction.</p>

          and Greek &#147;ou-topos&#148; (no place) which implies that the good place 
          is nowhere to be found. <br>

  <br>
  <b>LEARNING OUTCOMES</b>: At the end of this course, students will be able to:<br>
  1. use learned grammatical structures to speak and write in elementary or novice-level 
  French; <br>
  2. create written and oral sentences using learned vocabulary;<br>
  3. read French at the elementary or novice level;<br>
  4. understand spoken French at the elementary or novice level;<br>
  5. identify aspects of the cultures of the French-speaking world.<br>
  <br>
  <b>WELCOME TO FRENCH!</b> This course aims at giving you a solid foundation 
  in understanding, speaking, reading and writing the French language at the elementary 
  level. To accomplish these goals, it is essential that we use French as the 
  language of the classroom. Handy phrases for communicating in French: <br>
  <br>
  <font color="#FF0000"><i>R&eacute;p&eacute;tez, s'il vous pla&icirc;t</i></font><span class="style27">.</span>  = Repeat, please.<br>
  <font color="#FF0000"><i>Une minute, s'il vous pla&icirc;t</i></font><span class="style27">.</span>= Wait 
  a minute, please.<br>
  <font color="#FF0000"><i>Comment dit-on [English word] en fran&ccedil;ais</i></font><span class="style27">?</span>  = How do you say [English word] in French.?<br>
  <i><font color="#FF0000">Que veut dire [French word]</font></i><span class="style27">?</span>= What does 
  [French word] mean ?<br>
  <font color="#FF0000"><i>Qu'est-ce que c'est?</i></font> = What's that?<br>
  <font color="#FF0000"><i>Je ne sais pas</i></font><span class="style27">.</span> = I don't know.<br>
  <font color="#FF0000"><i>Je ne comprends pas</i></font><span class="style27">.</span> = I don't understand.<br>
  <br>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although the language of instruction and interaction in my classroom is French, I do not expect you to  understand every single word I am saying. Do not hesitate to let me know if your confusion gets in the way of class participation. I will find another way of getting my point across, whether it is by repeating, paraphrasing, elaborating, or simply slowing down. Raising your hand in class is the best way to let me know you have a question. Alternatively, you are welcome to see me after class or during my office hours. </font></font><span class="style25">Every student will benefit from one-to-one time with me whether you have questions about grammar, pronunciation, or simply to practice speaking French. </span></p>
<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>HOW TO DO WELL IN CLASS</b>: <br>
      <br>
1) <b>Prepare assignments before coming to class</b> so we can get the most 
  out of our class time together. Assignments are to be completed as indicated 
  on the syllabus. I expect you to have studied the grammar</font></font> <span class="style25">points as explained in the textbook and completed the homework <strong>before</strong> coming to class. In class, I will be presenting the same material in French as a <strong>review</strong> before we do face-to-face exercises (teacher-student and student-student) in class. Some students find it helpful to read written explanations in both <em>Motifs </em>and <em>English Grammar for Students of French</em> before coming to class, for difficult grammar points. </span><span class="style29"><span class="style25">You will find the approach that works best for you, depending on your learning style. </span></span></p>
<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2) <strong><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Homework is essential.</font></strong> There is a  <strong>significant</strong> amount of work for this class. It is important to keep up and   impossible to cram for this course 
  and do well. You will not be able to absorb all the grammar points from classroom instruction alone.  That is why there is homework,  a lab manual,  resources on the <a href="http://login.cengagebrain.com">Cengage</a> site, and my <a href="110supp.htm">Supplementary Materials</a> page. Learning a language is like building a house of cards: each one 
  must be well in place before adding the next. Getting behind can lead to serious difficulties. Spend at least 30 
  minutes on French per day. Regular 
  repetition of small quantities of information is the most successful method 
  for learning a foreign language.<br>
  <br>
  3) <b>Participate actively</b> in class. Mentally answer each and every 
  question when a classmate is responding. Class participation and homework make 
  up 25% of your grade. The more you participate, the better your grade will be, 
  and the better your French will become. Your class grade reflects your performance 
  in class (attendance, knowledge of daily lesson, volunteering answers, asking 
  questions). Take listening comprehension seriously &#151; it will help both your proficiency and your grade. There will be a listening component 
  on all exams. <br>
  <br>
  4) <b>Take risks</b>. Speak out. Don&#146;t be afraid to make mistakes. I am 
  here to help. The more you speak, the more you will get out of the class. Save perfection for exams. The desire to communicate is the most important 
  consideration when speaking. <br>
  <br>
  5) <b>Speak French as much as possible</b> in the classroom. Speak French outside 
  the classroom whenever possible, too. Listen to French music, go to French movies, 
eat French food!</font></font></p>
<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6) Do not chew gum in class. Having something in your mouth makes it harder to pronounce French correctly. <br>
  <br>
  7) <b>Bring <em>Motifs</em>  to class every day</b>. This is essential.  Bring a portable French/English-English/French dictionary to class, if you find it useful. Alternatively, you can consult an online resource such as <a href="http://wordreference.com">http://wordreference.com</a> or ask me for vocabulary assistance in class. <br>
  <br>
  8) <b>Take notes</b> in class whenever appropriate. Buy 3x5 notecards to make 
  personalized verb charts and other study aids. I like to use colored index cards with pink for feminine nouns and blue for masculine. Study with a friend
  outside of class. There are excellent study tips in <em>English Grammar for Students of French</em>.</font></font></p>
<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">)<strong> Cell phones</strong> must be turned off and <strong>mobile devices</strong> out of sight during class (unless you are using a dictionary app during for class work). If you need to know what time it is, you may ask me (in French, of course: <em>Quelle heure est-il</em>?) <br>
  <br>
  </font>I will do my best to keep the class atmosphere creative, lively, and accepting 
  of your best efforts. Both <strong>effort</strong> and <strong>ability</strong> will be rewarded. In return, you, too have some responsibilities. Please 
read carefully and follow the advice above and the information  given below. </font></p>
<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>GRADING</b>: Your grade in this course will be computed as follows: <br>
  Participation and attendance, Homework (Green pages, Lab manual, <em>English Grammar for Students of French</em>), Class Work: <span class="style27">25 %</span><br>
  Quizzes, Compositions/Projects, <em>Pays Francophone </em>Presentation, Museum Visit: <span class="style27">25 %</span><br>
  Exams: <span class="style27">25 %</span><br>
  Final Exam: <span class="style27">25 %</span><br>
  <br>
  There will be plus/minus grading in this class. The scale will be as follows:<br>
  A+ = 97.0-100, A = 93.0-96.9, A- = 90.0-92.9, <br>
  B+ = 87.0-89.9, B = 83.0-86.9, B- = 80.0-82.9, <br>
  C+ = 77.0-79.9, C = 73.0-76.9, C- = 70.0-72.9, <br>
  D+ = 67.0-69.9, D = 63.0-66.9, D- = 60.0-62.9,<br>
  F = 59.9 and below.<br>
  <br>
  <b>ATTENDANCE REGULATIONS</b>: Attendance is required and will be taken daily. 
  <span class="style22"> You are expected to arrive on time to class. Repeated tardiness will 
  affect your grade: three tardies will count as one absence.</span> Missing class will seriously hinder your ability to succeed in this class. The 
  following penalty will be applied: after three absences, your class participation 
  will be lowered one grade (from A to A-, from B+ to B, etc.) for EACH absence 
  beyond the limit. <br>
  <br>
  See me as soon as possible after an absence and provide a written excuse to 
  be accepted at my discretion (in case of illness, injury, death or illness in 
  the family, university duties, court attendance, or religious observance.) This 
  policy is based upon the University Attendance Policy at <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/academic_affairs/pols_regs/REG205.00.4.php">http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/academic_affairs/pols_regs/REG205.00.4.php</a><br>
  <br>
  If you need to miss a class for one of the reasons listed above, let me know 
  before the class meeting, if possible. Save your absences for emergencies. <strong>Excessive 
    absences may lead to an F for the course</strong>. Upon your return to class, you are 
  responsible for all work missed and for any assignments announced during your 
  absence. I suggest that you get the name and phone number or email address of a classmate 
  in the event that you are unsure of an assignment or wonder if there will be a verb quiz the day you return.</font></p>
<p class="style14"><strong> PARTICIPATION</strong><br>
  The particpation portion of  your grade will be determined using the following criteria and attendance requirements above. You will also have the opportunity to fill out a self-evaluation form at  the end of the semester. Reminder: Cell phones must be turned off before class. </p>
<p class="style33">A = Student comes to class prepared, bringing proper materials, arriving on time and staying the full length of the class. Student is attentive and frequently volunteers to participate. Student is actively involved in all class activities and stays on task in group work. Any questions and comments are pertinent.<br> 
  <br>
  B = Student is are usually prepared. Student is attentive, participates in all activities, and volunteers from time to time. Student asks only pertinent questions. <br>
  <br>
  C= Student shows evidence of being unprepared and may do homework or text during class. Student may arrive late or leave early. Student volunteers infrequently and may ask questions that would not be necessary had the student prepared for class.<br>
  <br>
  D = Student is unprepared and/or inattentive. Student rarely volunteers and demonstrates lack of involvement in class activities. Student may not stay on task in group work and may ask unnecessary or inappropriate questions. <br>
  <br>
  F = Student is disrespectful and exhibits a lack of concern for the class. His or her behavior 
  may have a negative effect on the class</p>
<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY</b>: The Foreign Language Department takes the University Policy on Academic Integrity very seriously. If you do not already have the pamphlet explaining this NCSU policy, ask your advisor for one. In accordance with this policy, you will be required to sign the Honor Pledge on every exam that you take in this class. The Honor Pledge reads: &quot;I have neither given nor received any unauthorized aid on this assignment or test.&quot; </font></p>
<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition, please be aware, that following University policy, it is my expressed understanding and expectation  that your signature on <em>any</em> homework assignment means that you have neither given nor received unauthorized aid. See: <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/academic_affairs/courses_undergrad/REG02.20.7.php">http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/academic_affairs/courses_undergrad/REG02.20.7.php</a><br>
  <br>
  Although you must complete and turn in your own work, you are encouraged to work with others in completing and preparing assignments outside of class, as well as some activities during class time. Such collaboration is authorized in this class. Quizzes and tests are the principal exceptions. However, copying or sharing of answers in or out of the classroom, from another student or from an answer key,  is in violation of the honor code. <span class="style33">Please ask me if you have any questions about these po</span><span class="style29">licies and please </span><span class="style33">do not give me any reason to be suspicious 
    of your honesty.</span> The Code of Student Conduct is located at <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/student_services/student_discipline/POL11.35.1.php">http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/student_services/student_discipline/POL11.35.1.php</a><br>
  <br>
  <b>EXAMS AND QUIZZES</b>: There will be 5-minute verbs quizzes at the <strong>beginning</strong> of class throughout the semester, announced at the previous class meeting. There will be no make-up quizzes. However, I will drop your lowest 
  quiz grade. There are also five class-long exams as well as an individual oral exam at midterm and a  
  final exam, all listed on the <a href="110syfa10.html">Syllabus</a>. Make-up for exams will be granted only if you are excused in advance 
  with proper documentation. </font></p>
<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There will be an hour-long review session conducted in my <span class="style27">Elluminate</span> virtual office the night before each exam. The exact time will be announced in class. Directions on how to access <span class="style27">Elluminate</span> are given on the <a href="110supp.htm">Supplementary Materials Page</a>. <br>
  <br>
  The oral part of the final exam will be given during the last week of 
  classes before final exams. Note the dates on the <a href="110syfa10.html">Syllabus</a>. <br>
  <br>
  <b>HOMEWORK</b>: Each module of the textbook is divided into two parts: 1) White 
  Pages (<i>Th&egrave;mes, Pratiques de conversation, Perspectives 
    culturelles, &Eacute;coutons ensemble, Lecture, Expression &eacute;crite</i>) and 2) <span class="style24">Green</span> Pages (<i>Structures</i> <em>utiles</em>) <br>
  <br>
  Before each class, look through the white pages (column 2 of the syllabus) so you know what 
  we will be doing in class. The audio for  each Module (indicated by the speaker graphic) is included on the <a href="http://login.cengagebrain.com">Cengage</a> web site. Listening to the exercises and the vocabulary will help you get used to hearing French. <br>
  <br>
  The third column in the syllabus lists selected <span class="style25"><em><font color="#990099"><strong>Lecture</strong></font></em>: <font color="#990099">reading exercises</font></span>. There are  corresponding written exercises <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">to  turn in listed on the syllabus </font>(<em>Compr&eacute;hension et int&eacute;gration; Et vous? Avez-vous compris</em>?) </font> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I will correct these for you. If you are having trouble with the reading questions, try writing out the question and translating it into English. I'll correct that, too.</font> <span class="style25">If you are struggle with a reading, we can go over it together  during an office hour. </span></p>
<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Your main homework is to write out the answers to exercises in the <span class="style24">green</span> pages (column 4 of the syllabus). You may choose to do the even or odd questions for each exercise, except for Tout Ensemble, where it makes sense to do all. Check this work using Appendix B (page 491 ff. in the textbook). All exercises 
  should be corrected clearly in <span class="style27"><span class="style5">a</span> different color</span>. If there are no errors, put a <span class="style27">check mark</span> by each section so I know that you've corrected your work. If you have questions about an exercise, write me a note on your homework. Reminder: copying answers from the textbook or workbook answer key without trying them on your own first, is not only a waste of time (what would you learn by copying?), but also an Academic Integrity violation (see above). </font><span class="style25">If you have no idea what the exercise is about, it makes sense to do one or two questions and  check  the answers to see  what is expected. You may also contact me. Try your best. You will <strong>never</strong> be graded on the number of errors in your homework or workbook. </span><span class="style29"><span class="style25">Mistakes are normal when you are learning, and I expect to see mistakes and corrections on all of your homework. Revising and correcting <strong>your own</strong> errors is the best way to ensure that you do not make the same error on a test. </span></span></p>
<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You will turn in the corrected 
  work from the green pages daily and all other written assignments  when 
  indicated on the syllabus. Please put the page numbers at the top of each homework assignment.<b> Full credit will be given only for corrected work turned in on time.</b> <br>
  <br>
  You will also do the  exercises in the Workbook/Lab Manual pages corresponding to each Module. <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All exercises should be corrected clearly in a <span class="style27">different 
  color</span>.  The answers are in the Workbook Answer Key. For copyright reasons, I have placed a copy of the key on reserve in DH Hill Library and posted it on our <a href="http://moodle.wolfware.ncsu.edu/">Moodle</a> site: If there are no errors, put a <span class="style27">check mark</span> by each exercise so I know at a glance that you've corrected your work. Mark any sections you don't understand so that you can ask about them 
  in class or I can explain when I'm correcting your work. <br>
  <br>
  </font>In the first half of the Workbook, you may do even or odd questions in each exercise, but you must do each exercise. Except for Module 5, you will  skip <em>Synth&egrave;se</em>, as indicated on the Syllabus. I<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">n the second half of the Workbook/Lab manual, y</font>ou will need to do <strong>all</strong> the questions.  Suggested completion dates are 
  indicated on the syllabus.     Bring your Workbook/Lab 
    Manual exercises to each exam so that I can give you credit for your work. You may write in your book or on a separate sheet of paper. You will 
  get full credit (10 points) for complete and corrected (in a <span class="style27">different color</span>) 
  exercises and partial credit (5 points) for uncorrected exercises or late work. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  <br>
  Listening Comprehension and Pronunciation Exercises in the Lab Manual (final section of the textbook) are to be completed with the audio available online, either on the <a href="http://login.cengagebrain.com">Cengage</a> site or our <a href="http://moodle.wolfware.ncsu.edu/">Moodle</a> site.</font></p>

      <b>COMPOSITIONS</b> <i>Expression &eacute;crite </i> and <i>Synth&egrave;se.</i><br>
  You will write a double-spaced, handwritten or word-processed composition for each Module, 
submitting a first draft and final version for each. The due date for the first 
draft is indicated on the syllabus. Learn to type accents on your computer. 
You will find an explanation of how to do this on the <a href="110supp.htm">Supplementary Materials</a> page (see <span class="style27">Accents</span>).  Drafts will be returned with <a href="110CorrectionSymbols.html">corrections</a> indicated. Beginning with Module 3, I will be giving you a grade for the revised compositions. Unrevised compositions will receive a check  mark which corresponds to a C when I calculate the final grade. Compositions will be graded using the <a href="110writingassessment.html">Writing Assessment Rubric</a>. </font></p>
<p class="style22"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reminder: do <strong>not</strong> use on-line translators for writing assignments for more than individual words or phrases. <strong>Do</strong> use your dictionary or <a href="http://www.wordreference.com/">http://www.wordreference.com/</a>. <br>
  <br>
  When you use a dictionary, make sure that your word fits the context in French. For example: the noun <span class="style27">match</span> in English may correspond to <span class="style32">un</span> <span class="style27"><em>match</em></span> in French (a sporting event) or <span class="style32">une allumette</span> (used to light a fire).

Please choose at least two works of art  to focus on, and share your impressions of the museum overall, as well. This paper, which has the same weight as a composition, may be turned in anytime during the semester, but must be turned in by your Final Oral  Exam, during the last week of classes. As part of the midterm and final oral exams, you will be reponsible for discussing in French one of the art works in the NCMA collection.

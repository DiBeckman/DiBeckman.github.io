<p><a href="222Love All Along (corrected version).mp3">&quot;Love All Along&quot;</a> by Joey Harper</p>
<p>Creative Rewriting Project for James Joyce's &quot;The Dead&quot;</p>
<p>Verse 1<br />
  I've got a suspicion<br />
Of your submission<br />
To some event greater than tonight<br />
And now my heart's filling up with fright<br />
</p>
<p>The snow  is blowin'<br />
  The coldness is growin'<br />
  So tell me girl what's on your mind<br />
  What's gotten into you tonight<br />
</p>
<p>Chorus (X2)<br />
Oh, oh Gretta<br />
I wish I had know that when I met ya<br />
Now we've got 2 kids and a house and a dog<br />
And you've been in love with some dead guy all along<br />
(Oh, oh, oh)</p>
<p>Verse 2<br />
  Her lips are movin'<br />
  But I can't comprehend<br />
I can't understand what she's saying</p>
<p>My stomach's out of place<br />
  My mind begins to race<br />
  And all I can think to say is<br />
  <br />
  Chorus (x2)<br />
  <br />
  Bridge<br />
  How scared you must have felt<br />
  When the song took you back<br />
And tore open your mended heart<br />
And reminded you of what you laced</p>
<p>How alone you must have felt<br />
  Keeping it bottled up inside<br />
Whoa oh<br />
As your memories collide</p>
<p>(Oh, oh, oh)</p>
<p>Chorus (x2)</p>

<p class="style2">Some quotes from Chekhov:</p>
<p class="style1">&ldquo;I can only write from memory, not direct from nature. The subject of my story must first pass through the filter of my mind, so that only the typical and significant remains.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style1">&ldquo;You should sit down to write only when you feel as cold as ice.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="style1">&ldquo;Throw your personality overboard, don&rsquo;t make yourself the hero of your story, renounce yourself for at least half an hour&hellip; Your play will be no good if all characters are like you&hellip; Give people people, not yourself&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="style1">&ldquo;I have believed in progress&hellip;for the difference between the time I used to be beaten [by my father] and the time when I ceased to be beaten, was tremendous. Reason and justice tell me that in electricity and steam there is more love for mankind than in chastity and abstinence from meat.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="style1">&ldquo;Medicine is my lawful wife, literature my mistress.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="style1">&ldquo;Odd, I have now a mania for shortness. Whatever I read&mdash;my own work, or other people&rsquo;s &mdash;it all seems to me not short enough.&rdquo; In his notebook he copied a page from Daudet &mdash;&ldquo;Why, a bird was asked,&rdquo; are your songs so short? Are you short of breath?&rdquo; And the bird answered: I have very many songs, and I should like to sing them all.&rdquo;] When asked what he would do if he were rich, Chekhov replied: &ldquo;Write the tiniest possible stories. Were I a millionaire I would produce works no longer than the palm of my hand.&rdquo; He advised another writer to cut out the beginning and end of his story: &ldquo;It is there that we authors do most of our lying.&rdquo; &ldquo;A single detail suffices&rdquo; provided it is the right one.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;&ldquo;When one is thirsty, one feels one could drink the ocean&mdash;that is <em>faith</em>; but when one has started drinking, one cannot swallow more than two glasses &mdash;that is <em>science</em>.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="style1">In honor of Sam Watson (Fall 2007): Notes from my lecture comparing Chekhov with our other authors which integrate the quotes above:</p>
<p class="style1">Like Wordsworth: he insisted on the need to compose in tranquility: &ldquo;I can only write from memory, not direct from nature. The subject of my story must first pass through the filter of my mind, so that only the typical and significant remains.&rdquo; Like Flaubert, he insisted on the need for detachment: &ldquo;You should sit down to write only when you feel as cold as ice.&rdquo; Also: &ldquo;Throw your personality overboard, don&rsquo;t make yourself the hero of your story, renounce yourself for at least half an hour&hellip;Your play will be no good if all characters are like you&hellip;Give people people, not yourself&hellip;A man of letters should be as objective as a chemist. If you would understand life, stop believing what is said and written; observe and meditate, yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="style1">Like Baudelaire, he also believed that brevity was an essential literary virtue. &ldquo;Odd, I have now a mania for shortness. Whatever I read&mdash;my own work, or other people&rsquo;s &mdash;it all seems to me not short enough.&rdquo; In his notebook he copied a page from Daudet &mdash;&ldquo;Why, a bird was asked,&rdquo; are your songs so short? Are you short of breath?&rdquo; And the bird answered: I have very many songs, and I should like to sing them all.&rdquo; When asked what he would do if he were rich, Chekhov replied: &ldquo;Write the tiniest possible stories. Were I a millionaire I would produce works no longer than the palm of my hand.&rdquo; Advised another writer to cut out the beginning and end of his story: &ldquo;It is there that we authors do most of our lying.&rdquo; &ldquo;A single detail suffices&rdquo; provided it is the right one.</p>
<p class="style1">Wanted to reconcile art and science: &ldquo;When one is thirsty, one feels one could drink the ocean&mdash;that is <em>faith</em>; but when one has started drinking, one cannot swallow above two glasses&mdash;that is <em>science</em>.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="style1">Unlike Flaubert with his seemingly endless detail and description, Chekhov would rather gracefully choose one detail to suggest a whole person or relationship: one of the reason he translates well compared to some other writers, especially poets is that he uses similes rather than metaphors; chooses from a limited palate of words. Russian writer and critic Vladmir Nabokov writes: &ldquo;Chekhov keeps all his words in the same dim light and of the exact tint of gray, a tint between the color of an old fence and that of a low cloud.&rdquo; Clouds, fences, grey all play important role in our short story. <br>

<p class="style1">From Chapter 2<br>
  Anna Sergeyevna, &quot;the lady with the dog,&quot; seemed to regard the affair as something very special, very serious, as if she had become a<strong> fallen woman</strong>, an attitude he found odd and disconcerting. </p>
<p class="style6">For a fascinating look at images of the <strong>fallen woman</strong> in Victorian painting, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_and_Present_(paintings)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_and_Present_(paintings)</a> .</p>
<p class="style6">Anna is also compared to Mary Magdalene (<strong>Maudlin</strong> derives from the name Mary Magdalene, who was often shown with her eyes swollen from weeping. It implies a lack of self-restraint, particularly in the form of excessive tearfulness) in her fallen woman pose.<br>

<p class="style14">In addition, for this and the next assignment, take a look at  my web page on <a href="Explication.html"><em>Explication de Texte</em></a> and these web sites about figures of speech which are also listed on the handy <a href="222supmatf04.html">Supplementary Materials</a> page.<font color="#990000"><font color="#000000"> These pages will  be useful for your <a href="222poetrypresentation.html">Poetry Presentation</a> due</font></font><span class="style13"> Wednesday, February 3 </span><font color="#990000"><span class="style43"><font color="#000000">and </font></span></font><span class="style43"><span class="style13">Friday, February 5 </span></span></p>
<p class="style14"><font color="#990000"><span class="style43"><font color="#000000">Here is a link to a quiz you can take to assess your knowledge of the &quot;Top 20 figures of speech&quot; by Richard Norquist: <a href="http://grammar.about.com/od/terms/a/revquiz20terms.htm?p=1">http://grammar.about.com/od/terms/a/revquiz20terms.htm?p=1</a><br />

This site contains figures of speech, thought, repetition, more than you can shake a stick at! Most examples are drawn from Shakespeare.  </font></span></font></p>

</a>This site is very cool because it has sound clips and draws from a wide range of speeches, movies, and more to illustrate the Figures of Speech. For example, see and listen to quotes from Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln, and Neil Armstrong on the page about antitheses: <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/figures/antithesis.htm">http://www.americanrhetoric.com/figures/antithesis.htm</a></p>
<p class="style1"><span class="style7">Class 3: (Pope, Lecture 2) </span><span class="style13">due Friday, January 15 <br />
      <span class="style4">1) Print out <a href="AcademicIntegrityPledge.html">Academic Integrity form</a>. Please sign, date  
        and turn it in. </span></span> <br />
    <br />
  2) Read <em>Essay on Man</em> and write a page about your stanza to turn in. In case you're not sure what a <em>stanza</em> is, you can look this and other literary terms up in our course <a href="222Glossary.html">Glossary</a>, a web site such as <a href="http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms.html">http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms.html</a> or your laminated <a href="http://www.barcharts.com/Inventory/Navision/9781572225886">Literary Terms Quick Study Guide</a>.</p>
<p class="style1"> Note that the Roman numerals I-X at the beginning of each stanza correspond to your assigned stanza number (not a page or line number). What is the stanza about? Give a one sentence summary. Answer the 4 questions from Shannon. Also, what are the key words and images in the stanza? How does the stanza connect with the ideas of the Enlightenment we've discussed? What is  the attitude of the narrator? What is the role of nature, especially animals, if any appear in your stanza?</p>
<p class="style1">3)<span class="style7"> <span class="style44">After reading Shannon Chapter 1, write your own definition of literature to turn in. Make it as short and complete as possible.</span></span> You can put it on the same sheet of paper as your discussion of your stanza. </p>
<p class="style1">4) Your first WebCT post is due at midnight on Friday. <br />
  Instructions: Login to <a href="http://vista.ncsu.edu/index.php">WebCT Vista</a>. <br />
  Do the Browser check and enable pop-up windows.<br />
  Enter your Unity ID and Password. <br />
  On your My Courses page, click on FL 222. <br />
  If you are new to WebCT, click on Student Orientation to WebCT. Read Sections 1 and 5. <br />
  To see the first discussion assignment, go back to the Home Page and click on Discussion Topics.<br />
  Click on Introduction.<br />
  You will see the first topic, Introductory Post, by me. Read the assignment (Please introduce yourself to the rest of the class and tell us: if you could invite any three people, alive, dead or fictional, to dinner at your place, whom would you invite, why, and what would you serve?). Respond. </p>
<p class="style1">5) See the <a href="Type/ExtraCreditType.html">Extra Credit Assignment on <em>Myers-Briggs Type in College</em></a> I'm INFJ. If you have comments or questions about Myers-Briggs Type, feel free to share them as part of the introduction. You can do this assignment any time in the first month of classes. </p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style7">Class 4 (Voltaire, Lecture 1)</span> <span class="style13">due Wednesday, January 20 </span><br />
  <br />
1) Write a page about the first thirteen chapters of <em>Candide</em> answering Shannon's 4 questions. </p>
<p class="style14">2) Print out Lecture Notes on <a href="222ShortStoryNovel.html">Different Forms of Prose Fiction</a>; <a href="222SatireIronyUtopia.html">Satire, Irony and Utopia</a>. Read <a href="222Panglossian.htm">Panglossian</a>. </p>
<p class="style14">3) Read Shannon, Chapter 2. </p>
<p class="style14">4) Consider bookmarking an online dictionary or two to make it easy to look up words you don't know. If you are doing the Reading Notebook, you can print out the definitions to include in your notebook. <br />
    <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/">http://dictionary.reference.com/</a><br />
  <a href="http://www.m-w.com/">http://www.m-w.com/</a></p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style4">5) I signed up for a new word-a day- email because they have such cool quotes: <a href="http://wordsmith.org/awad/subscribe.html">http://wordsmith.org/awad/subscribe.html</a><br />
  If you need to build your vocabulary (taking the GRE?), it's a great way to learn about words. I am trying to figure out how to make it an extra credit opportunity. If you have any ideas, let me know. </span></p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style45">Class 5 (Voltaire, Lecture 2) <span class="style13">due Friday, January 22 </span><br />
      <span class="style4">Discuss the following questions after you do the reading assignment (Chapters 14-22). Is Eldorado a genuine utopia or (in one critic's words) &quot;a colossal bore&hellip;satirized by Voltaire as foolish and futile&quot;? </span></span><span class="style45"><span class="style4">Which specific behaviors or institutions show us that Voltaire wants the reader to see Eldorado as utopic? <br />
Does Voltaire have a philosophical lesson in mind or is it pure satire? Or both?</span></span> How does it correspond to your personal view of Utopia? <span class="style4">Quote from the text with examples to support your answers and include the page reference for each quotation.</span></p>
<p class="style14">See Lecture Notes on <a href="222dulce.html">Dulce et utile</a>.</p>
<p class="style14">The first original contribution post&mdash;on Pope&mdash;is due Friday at midnight. You will have many authors to choose from to do your required 13 posts (7 original contributions and 6 responses), but I encourage you to get in the habit of posting by starting with Pope or Voltaire. For an original contribution post, make a point or develop an argument of at least 7 lines based on something you read, learned or thought while reading <em>An Essay on Man</em>. It can be helpful to ask a question or make a provocative statement for your classmates to respond to. Did something in your homework get praise or a lot of comment from me? If so, it might be the basis of a good post. </p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style7">Class 6 (Voltaire, Lecture 3)</span> <span class="style13">due Monday, January 25 </span><br />
  Read the page in Supplementary Materials, <a href="Candide%20quotes.html">Quotes from different critics about &quot;Il faut cultiver notre jardin.&quot; </a><br />
  Write a page answering the following questions: what are some  literal and figurative meanings of the word <em>garden</em>? How do they apply here? How do <strong>you</strong> interpret the final line of the story? <br />
  <br />
  To help you to understand the difference between <strong>literal</strong> and <strong>figurative</strong>, here is an example I found online at <a href="http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm">http://www.leasttern.com/LitTerms/literary_terms.htm</a> : <br />
<strong>literal</strong> vs. <strong>figurative</strong> meaning - relates to the meanings of words and phrases or expressions. For example, &quot;She was all ears&quot; has a <strong>figurative</strong> meaning (She was listening intently) as well as a <strong>literal</strong> meaning (Her body was composed of ears or she had a huge set of ears). </p>
<p class="style14">Read Shannon, Chapter 3. </p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style7">Class 7 (Romanticism; Pushkin, Lecture 1) </span><span class="style13">due Wednesday, January 27 <br />

      <br />
Here are two additional, more modern, sets of critical questions you may choose to address. They were written by a former student, Garry Pigg (Fall, 2005)</p>
<p class="style33">ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM:<br />
  <span class="style4">1. How do the environmental/ecological conditions within the setting of the work affect the language, mood, tone, and theme?<br />
  2. How does the use of the word &quot;nature&quot; in the work reflect the current scientific beliefs of the time and how does that affect the characters, plot, themes?<br />
  3. How does the relationship between man/woman and his/her environment--economically, agriculturally, botanically, socially--affect the characters, language, theme, plot, and tone? i.e. do the characters have to hunt and gather, farm, trade, live in city, country?<br />
  4. How do plants, animals, and their conditions in the environment affect the character's livelihood, the plot, the author's tone, the moods, the theme? i.e. the effects of individual species such as cows, camels, horses, goats, bananas, sugar, cotton, corn, potatoes, fungi, bacteria,<br />
viruses; and ambient conditions such as drought, flooding, pollution, climate change, introduction of invasive species, and famine.</span></p>
<p class="style33">QUEER THEORY: <span class="style4"> Lauren N.</span></p>
<p class="style14">1. How do the cultural feelings about sex affect the characters, plot, and themes?<br />
  2. How does sexual identity affect the characters? How do they deal with others and their own sexual deviance or breaking of social norms?<br />
  3. How does homosexuality or bisexuality play a role in the characters' lives, the tone, mood, theme, and plot of the work?<br />
  4. What role does sexuality play in the work?  How does it affect the use of language? Does it represent love and beauty or marriage and<br />
  reproduction?<br />
  5. How does religion affect the tendencies of the characters to express or not express themselves sexually?<br />
  6. How does the work represent sex and sexuality?  Does it use sexuality to define &quot;others&quot;? Does discussion of sex in the work hinder or help feminism?  Does it hurt or help racism, discrimination in general, and civil rights?  What is the connection between sexuality, race, gender, and social class in the work(s)?</p>

  <br />
  <span class="style3"><strong>&bull; FORMALIST CRITICISM:</strong><br />
  - How do Emma's romantic ideals influence the plot of the story?<br />
  - As a realist novel, what issues of reality is Flaubert trying to bring to the reader's attention?
  <br />
  - How does the theme of deceit relate to the underlying principle of the story?<br />
  </span><br />
  <strong>&bull; SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM </strong><br />
&nbsp; <span class="style32"><strong>Marxist Criticism:</strong><br />
- Does
the work portray any forms of exploitation of the proletariat by the bourgeosie?<br />
- How do you think Flaubert attemps to mimic or exploit the bourgeois in <em>Madame Bovary</em> through the successes or failures of the main character?
<br />
- How does Flaubert portray the bourgeois in <em>Madame Bovary</em>? a) How do Emma's transformations farm girl -&gt; professional's wife -&gt; &quot;charitable&quot; matron -&gt; crazy hedonist reflect the <u>value system</u> of the middle class then and now?  b) How does Flaubert critique the bourgeois? Do his depictions of consumerism and naked desire for comfort and appearance implicity critique consumerism and French society? c) How does his critique of actual elements of 19th century French society compare to his Realist ideas about Romanticism?<br />
- If Emma is not satisfied with her economic status and lifestyle why did she agree and settle to marry Charles, a non-romantic man who was not exceedingly wealthy to fulfill her desires?<br />
- When Flaubert is taking notice of almost all the characters' attire (no matter their significance in the story) and which social class they belong to, do you think that he is pointing out the wrongs of having social classes or just simply presenting them so that the reader can relate to the story?<br />
</span><br />
&nbsp; <span class="style91"><strong>Feminist Criticism: </strong><br />
-
  What is Flaubert's opinon of  women? Flaubert seems to write very specifically about how and what a woman thinks, therefore what is his opinion about women, outside the fiction realm?<br />
  - Why are female characters important in literary history? Are they, in fact, important or not?<br />
  - How does Flaubert portray his views about women and their roles in the 1800's through Emma's character? Do his opinions of women differ from society's in that time period?<br />
  - What is the relationship between Emma and Charles? Do they have a loving one or is it strictly business? Does Emma reject or accept the role of being a mother?<br />
  - Why does the author have three different Madame Bovarys in the story? Do they all not deserve a different name, so they can be distinguished?<br />
  - Do you think Emma's actions of infidelity and search for seemingly aimless passions is a product of the society in which she lived? Can she be blamed for her actions with such a limited and uninspiring role in the society in which she lived?<br />
  - 
  How do the choices and actions of Emma influence the way male characters view and act toward her? Overall, does the author portray the lives of women as below the lives of men? Give examples. <br />
  - How did the choices that Emma made in her life limit or contribute to her attitude, behavior and her outcome?<br />
  - What is Emma's role in society?<br />
  - How do the men treat the women in this story? Are the women valued?<br />
  - Are the events going on at the time this novel was written reflected in the story? How about the views on women and their roles?<br />
  - How are the women depicted in this novel?<br />
  - Why do you think Flaubert made his female characters this way? How do you think he views women based on this story?<br />
  - How do the men and women in this sotry compare to one another? Look at Madame Bovary vs. her husband (both sets).<br />
  </span><br />
  <span class="style92"><strong>&bull; 
  CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM:</strong><br />
- When   <em>Madame Bovary </em>was written, adultery by women was not discussed. Why does Flaubert speak so openly about her actions? To make a political statement? To let us know Emma does not fit her time period/lifestyle?<br />
- <em>Madame Bovary</em> is praised for its depiction of French provincial life? What aspects of it draw you into the book (or not)? And why?<br />
- How did the French Revolution and the growth of the middle class shape <em>Madame Bovary</em>?</span><br />
<br />
<span class="style93"><strong>&bull; 
  PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM: </strong><br />
  -
  What do Emma's emotions and behavior reveal about her psychological state? Think in particular about her battle with depression.<br />
  - What aspects or incidents in Emma's past reflect her dreams or false reality that now consume her?<br />
  - What does Emma Bovary's desire for a different life suggest about her psychological state/personality? How does it differ from Charles Bovary's psychological state/personality?<br />
  - What does (young) Madame Bovary's inability to be satisfied or even content say aobut her psychological status?<br />
  - Describe
  the differences in Emma's and Charles' personalities. Do you believe Charles is really <u>that</u> naive? Why do you think Flaubert chose to make them so different? <br />
</span><span class="style94"><br />
<strong>&bull;
  READER RESPONSE CRITICISM: </strong><br />
  - Why does Gustave Flaubert write a story with the main character getting into so many affairs and bouncing from man to man without ever feeling happy?<br />
  - When reading <em>Madame Bovary, </em>what did you expect to happen, based on past novels you have read?<br />
  - It is very interesting to see the personalities of all the different characters. Which character do you think is the most like yourself? Why?<br />
  - What
  do you think the writer's purpose was? Do you have any questions that you would like answered?<br />
  - In Part 1, which passages made you respond unexpectedly to the events that took place?<br />
  - After completing the reading of Part 1, were your intitial predictions of the story correct or were you completely mistaken in your interpretations?<br />
  - With Gustave Flaubert's writing, do you believe it was written for any audience. If not, what specifications
  do you think there might have been?<br />
  - Were there any key passages that you didn't understand or could be interpreted in two or more different ways?<br />
  - As a reader, if you were placed in the same setting/situation with the characters, would you have reacted any differently to Charles, Emma, or the secondary characters? If so, how?</span>  <br />
  <span class="style95"><br />
&bull; ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM:<br />
  - How does Emma's love imagery of water, storms, floods, etc coincide with her experience with nature? Does she reject nature as she burns her wedding bouquet, which obviously no longer has significance for her?<br />
  - How does Emma Bovary's relationship with her environment (in all the locations she stays at) affect her mood, actions, and plans for the future?<br />
  - What is the importance of describing the environment the characters work/live in?<br />
- Throughout <em>Madame Bovary</em> there were numerous incidents when the characters were compared to farm animals. What descriptions of the animal were used for each character? What is the figurative meaning behind each character and his/her animal?<br />
- In <em>Madame Bovary</em>,  Flaubert uses a lot of biological or environmental determinism that prevented the characters doing whatever, and therefore controlling their fate. Emma is the best example. What are the two biological factors that help determine Emma's fate? Is her innate behavior or her outside environment more of an influence on her? </span><br />
<br />
<span class="style97"><strong>&bull; QUEER THEORY: </strong><br />
  -
  How have we seen Emma use sex and love to create an identity she desires? How does this pursuit work out for her? What do we know about Rodolphe's view of love and of Emma? What if Emma knew everything we know?<br />
  - Sexuality and romance are two recurring themes in <em>Madame Bovary</em>. alongside these themes, Charles and Emma both have a relationship together as well as with several other people through the work. Do the two themes of sexuality and romance go hand in hand in the many relationships Charles and Emma encounter or are these themes completely separate? In other words, do Charles and Emma have a sexual relationship, a romantic one, or a combination of the two? What about the other relationships in which Charles and Emma are involved?<br />
  - How does the sexual relationship between Leon and Emma affect the sexual relationship of Charles and Emma and even her demeanour around others?<br />
  - Sex affects the characters in different ways even if the basic outcome is the same. For Emma and Charles, their sex leads to their baby, Berthe, however, Emma and Charles clearly have different feelings towards their child. What are the difference and similarities, if any?<br />
- How did society's view of sexuality affect the characters' view of sexuality?<br />
- What qualities in a character let the reader know how the character interprets sexuality? Do some strictly want it for reproduction or some just explore every possibility through boredom or curiosity?<br />
- Do a man and woman interact differently than two men or two women? How does this affect the story?<br />

  <br />
  Writing Assignment:<br />
  In your assigned act of the play, give a 1-2 sentence summary of what happens. 
Trace the binary opposition between  the themes of <strong>truth</strong> and <strong>corruption</strong>. Identify the principal conflict: which characters support or oppose each other? Why? What are the key passages?</p>
<p class="style14">Next,  choose one of the following questions to answer: <br />
  1) Critics say that <em>An Enemy of the People</em> inspired Steven Spielberg&rsquo;s <em>Jaws</em>, where the hero tries to convince the local public officials of a shark threat to public safety. Give an example that you have heard of where environmental or public health issues were at first covered up by government or business interests. How does that real-life situation compare with the one in Ibsen&rsquo;s play?<br />
  <br />
  OR<br />
  <br />
2) Have you personally experienced group pressure to conceal information that might harm others? Describe the situation and the outcome. </p>

<p class="style16"><span class="style89">&bull; <strong>FORMALIST CRITICISM</strong><br />
  - How does Gregory's family help to reinforce the symbolism of Gregory being turned into a giant bug?<br />
  - With this being a novel from the modern era, what is Franz Kafka saying about the types of reactions that each of his family members have towards Gregory because he is different?<br />
  - Would the story be any different if Gregory was not turned into a roach? Perhaps a less-hated bug? Maybe a ladybug or butterfly?<br />
  - What is Kafka's message for the reader?</span><span class="style14"><span class="style31"><span class="style32"><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style4">&bull; </span></span></span><span class="style4"><strong>SOCIOLOGICAL CRITICISM</strong></span><span class="style32"><br />
&nbsp; <strong>Marxist Criticism</strong><br />
- How did Gregory's financial conditions impact his life and his family's life? <br />
- How did Kafka's beliefs of atheism and socialism affect his writing of <em>The Metamophosis</em>?<br />
- Does Gregory's lack of income mean that it is his fault his famiy is struggling?
<br />
- What aspects of Gregory's new situation or new boy as a bug, display Marxist attitude or ideology? <br />
- If Gregor is a critical part of the family's financial and overall well-being, why does the family begin to gradually betray him as a member of the family after he morphed into a bug? <br />
&nbsp;<br />
  </span></span><span class="style92">Feminist Criticism<br />
  - What gender role does Grete adhere to in the first part of <em>The Metamophosis</em>?<br />
  - How do the the female characters (mom and sister) influence the way Greogor is treated in contast with how his father views him? <br />
  - How do Greogry's different relationships within his family vary, and how do they impact him and this story? His sister? Mom? Dad? </span><span class="style14"><span class="style32"><br />
  <strong><br />
  </strong></span></span><span class="style121">&bull; 
    CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CRITICISM</span><span class="style49"><br />
    - What does Gregor, the insect, signify culturally or historically in the first two sections of the story? <br />
    - What does this story say about the importance of <strong>appearance</strong> in society?<br />
    - In this time, were men the primary breadwinners of the family? Did this cause major stress in Gregory's life?<br />
    - Do you think that Kafka's <em>Metamophosis</em> is supposed to be representative of the commonality of alienation and disorientation in the 20th century or simply an entertaining story? </span><span class="style14"><span class="style32"><br />
    <br />
    <span class="style93">&bull; 
    PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM<br />
    - How does Gregor&rsquo;s physical transformation play an effect on his personal psychological state?<br />
    - What does this wonderful work express about the author&rsquo;s, Franz Kafka's, psychological state?<br />
    - How do the changes in Gregory Samsa from a human to an insect reflect the alientation and isolation that he demonstrates in his metamorphic life?<br />
    - What does the first half of <em>The Metamorphosis</em> reveal about Gregory's perception of his self-image and role in life? <br />
    - Do you think it was strange how unalarmed Greory was by his metamorphosis? He was more concerned about missing work than being a roach.<br />
  - What do you think each of Gregory's family members' reactions reveal about them?<br />
  - How does Gregor's change in physical appearance as well as economical responsibility change the psychological eminence of himself and his family?<br />
  - Are there other ways Gregory feels shame about his condition as an insect, other than feeling like a failure
for not being able to work and support his family financially?<br />
- What effect would such a transformation (physically being changed into some sort of an insect) have on Gregory's pyschological well-being if he never changes back to human form?<br />
- How does the relationship bewteen Gregor and his father represent Kafka's psychology?<br />
- The chief clerk refers to Gregory as a &quot;calm and sensitive person&quot; prior to his transformation. Does  this appear to remain true of Gregory after he changes? How can outward appearances shape our innter traits?<br />
- How does Kafka use the characters of this work to express his own psychological state?<br />
- Based on Gregory's often cool and calm descriptions of going on with normal life even though he is a bug, do  you think Gregory is in a altered or psychotic state? What does this tell us about Kafka himself? <br />
- In the first half of <em>The Metamophosis</em>, it seems like Gregory is more concerned wtih the dilemma of getting to work rather the fact that he has transformed into an insect overnight. Why do you think that is? What does this imply about his personality? </span><br />
<br />
<span class="style116">&bull;
  READER RESPONSE CRITICISM</span></span></span><span class="style116"><br />
    <span class="style14">- After reading the first two sections of <em>The Metamophosis</em>, what is your first response? Can you take this story seriously? <br />
    </span>- If you were in Gregory Samsa's position, would you have the same reaction and would your family react the same?<br />
  - If you were placed in a situation such as Gregor's and were transformed into another creature do you think you would have showed yourself to your family or would you have tried to hide until you were transformed back? <br />
  - How would you have responded differently in Gregory's situation as a bug?<br />
- Have you ever had dreams that actually impacted your expectations and actions in reality? Can you use this to associate with Gregory?<br />
- Why do you think the author chose to start out the story so abruptly stating that Gregory had turned into a giant bug instead of building up to that crucial event?<br />
- In 
<em>The Metamophosis</em>, Gregor Samsa wakes up in the morning to find himself transformed into an insect. He immediately thinks about the commitments he has to his job, obviously something that will be more difficult to attend to because of his current state as a bug. In your past experiences where you wake up one day and simply feel like not attending work, how did your excuse compare to Gregor's excuse? (even though the humans did not understand his speech)? <br />
- How would you feel if you were in Gregor's situation and dealing with his family's response to his situation? <br />
- How do your experiences and expectations affect your reading and interpretation<br />
- Why
would Franz Kafka write a story about a man turning into a bug? Why is this story important to you and can you relate to it? <br />
  </span><span class="style117"><br />
&bull; ECOLOGICAL CRITICISM<br />
  - Why would the author change Gregory to a giant bug? Why not another animal?<br />
  - What's the significance of the bug? Why not an inorganic thing?<br />
  - Why out of all the possible insects or animals that Gregor could transform into does he turn into a cockroach-like bug?
  How doe the rest of the characters respond to his transformation and how does the fact that he is now a cockroach affect what he is fed and his lifestyle? </span><span class="style32"><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style118">&bull;
  QUEER THEORY<br />
  - How did Gregory's family change before and after his &quot;insect&quot; transformation? <br />
  - How does Gregor's sudden transformation change the interaction he has with the other characters? Do you think this has any similarities to the interaction with others that a homosexual receives after &quot;coming out of the closet&quot;? </span></span><span class="style118"><br />

  <br />
  Writing Assignment (answer all 3 questions):<br />
Question 1: Who is Judith Shakespeare? Why does Woolf create her? What  is the message about women and women writers that Woolf suggests by telling the Judith's story? </p>
<p class="style14">Question 2: Choose any work we've read so far and speculate about how it might have been different if the work had been written by a woman rather than a man. (There is no right or wrong answer: let your imagination take you somewhere. Would the characters be different? The plot? The ending? How does the author's gender impact his or her art?)</p>

Sutton Theatre, 301 Pogue St., Raleigh, North Carolina 27607. TICKETS: $18 ($15 students and seniors 62+), except all seats $10 on April 11th.</p>
<p class="style14">I highly recommend it!! It is a modernist play. My favorite love scene in the theatre takes place in Act 2. A great paper topic would be to compare Emily's epiphany in Act 3 to Gabriel's in <em>The Dead</em>.

</span></p>
<p class="style14">- Step 2: read Shannon chapter 5, pp. 100 &#150; 132; write a first draft of 1-2 pages about one of the topics below for the peer review session. It should have a working title and a fully formulated introduction (you can rewrite them later, but they need to be there for the draft) and several finished paragraphs; your audience knows the text, so you should avoid plot summaries. Use the present tense for literary analysis: Ivan <strong>is</strong> an ambitious&hellip; Flaubert <strong>reveals</strong>&hellip; Include your outline. This is the peer review draft version of your paper; print and bring 2 copies of it to class. Include the <a href="PeerReviewFeedback.html">Peer Review Feedback form</a> with each copy. </p>

<p class="style14">Dr. Beckman's hint about titles: A dull title sets expectations low. A good title invites the reader! Quotes, proverbs or aphorisms make great titles. Try a google search with a key word from your thesis (pride, satisfaction, quest, etc) and the word quote. I've already got a <a href="222Lovequotes.html">web page</a> with love quotes for you to use, since love is such a popular topic. </p>

    <span class="style4">No class meeting, but you should come to the classroom to drop off the complete draft of    </span></span><span class="style4">your paper.</span> See the <a href="222Paper2010.html">Paper page</a> for full details.<br />
    <br />
<span class="style43">-Step 3: Reflect on your peer reviewers' suggestions and write a full draft of your paper to turn in to me. Proofread following Shannon's list on 108. I will not grade the paper at this point but will return it to you with comments, so that you can write the final draft. Consult the <a href="222scoringrubric.html">Scoring Rubric for Papers</a> so that you'll know what I will be looking for when I do grade the paper. This web page  from the NCSU Writing and Speaking Tutorial site offers guidelines to help you revise and edit your draft: <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/tutorial_center/writespeak/Revising.htm">http://www.ncsu.edu/tutorial_center/writespeak/Revising.htm</a></span></p>
<p class="style14">Pay attention to good organization and logical transitions between paragraphs. 
  Base your arguments on close readings. Two areas that are normally weak in the first draft are the use of quotations and the conclusion.   Give concrete examples (quotes) from 
  the texts to support your arguments, but not to fill up space. Shannon has an excellent section on how to incorporate quotations into your paper: pages 150-163. For quotations from the text, keep in mind that they are the evidence you need to provide to prove your point. You will usually use at least one in each of body paragraphs. In order to integrate quotes appropriately, be sure to introduce the quote by making the point the quote illustrates, include the quote (usually 3-5 lines of text), and then tie the quote back into your argument with a concluding sentence: &quot;&hellip;remind your reader that these passages are there to prove a point. End your discussion on your words, not theirs.&quot; (162-3). Part III of the Midterm was designed to give you experience with this aspect of literary paper writing. </p>
<p class="style14">A conclusion is very important to a fully developed paper. Shannon discusses this well on pages 98-99. He asks you to think about whether you've answered a key question in the conclusion to your paper: &quot;So what?&quot; I will be asking the same question when I read your paper <br />
    <br />
  You are not required to use secondary sources (books, articles, internet) for this paper, but if you do, be sure to quote and document them properly and attach a &#147;Works Cited&#148; page.<strong> </strong>For information on using research (if you do) and writing the documentation page, consult Shannon chapter 6 (pp. 164 &#150; 196).</p>

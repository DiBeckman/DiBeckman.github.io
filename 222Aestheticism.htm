<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font color="#FF0000">Aestheticism</font></strong><br>
19th century <font color="#FF0000">aestheticism</font> holds that art should be independent of social, political, or moral teaching. Hence the doctrine of <em>l'art pour l'art</em> (see <font color="#FF0000"><a href="222Art4Art.html">Art for Art's Sake</a></font>), a concept derived from the philosopher Immanuel Kant as well as Edgar Allan Poe's argument that the supreme poem is one written for its own sake. Aestheticism was headquartered in France with Baudelaire and Walter Pater in England. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&bull; &quot;There is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well-written, or badly written, that is all.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&bull; &quot;It is through Art, and through Art only, that we can shield ourselves from the sordid perils of actual existence.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&bull; &quot;In matters of grave importance, style not sincerity, is the most crucial thing.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- For insight into the structure of the play, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-made_play">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-made_play</a>: &quot;Oscar Wilde's <em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em> exaggerates many of the conventions of the well-made play, such as the missing papers conceit (the hero, as an infant, was confused with the manuscript of a novel) and a final revelation (which, in this play, occurs about thirty seconds before the final curtain).&quot;</font></p>
